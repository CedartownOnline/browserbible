# Browser Bible 

A browser based Bible Study Application built with the holy trinity of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

* Created by: [http://www.dbsbible.org](Digital Bible Society)
* Project Leader: John Dyer [http://j.hn/](http://j.hn/)
* Code License: GPLv2/MIT
* Content License: See each content folder for a license

## Goals

HTML and JavaScript based Bible software that can run

* on any browser
* on any device
* in any nation

The application has full search and highlighting features but requires

* no install
* no server
* no trace

To make this happen, there are two ways to view the same biblical content

* *Mobile Version* - The mobile version uses [http://www.jquerymobile.com/](jQuery Mobile) to navigate through the Bible chapter by chapter
* *Desktop Version* - The desktop version is a multipane application based off ideas at [http://biblewebapp.com/](http://biblewebapp.com/)

## Credits
