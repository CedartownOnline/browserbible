<span class="verse Col_4_11" data-osis="Col.4.11"><span class="verse-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span>Joshua, who is called Justus, also sends his greeting. These are the only converts from Judaism who have worked with me for the kingdom of God; I have found them a great comfort.</span>
<span class="verse Col_4_12" data-osis="Col.4.12"><span class="verse-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span>Epaphras, who is one of yourselves, sends you his greeting.
