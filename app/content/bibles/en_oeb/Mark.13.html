<span class="verse" data-osis="Mark.13.1"><span class="verse-num verse-1">1&nbsp;</span>As Jesus was walking out of the Temple Courts, one of his disciples said to him: &ldquo;Teacher, look what fine stones and buildings these are!&rdquo;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Mark.13.2"><span class="verse-num">2&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> &ldquo;Do you see these great buildings?&rdquo;</span>  asked Jesus. <span class="woc"> &ldquo;Not a single stone will be left here upon another, which shall not be thrown down.&rdquo;</span></span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="Mark.13.3"><span class="verse-num">3&nbsp;</span>When Jesus had sat down on the Mount of Olives, facing the Temple, Peter, James, John and Andrew questioned him privately:</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Mark.13.4"><span class="verse-num">4&nbsp;</span>&ldquo;Tell us when this will be, and what will be the sign when all this is drawing to its close.&rdquo;</span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="Mark.13.5"><span class="verse-num">5&nbsp;</span>Then Jesus began: <span class="woc"> &ldquo;See that no one leads you astray.</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Mark.13.6"><span class="verse-num">6&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> Many will take my name, and come saying &lsquo;I am He&rsquo;, and will lead many astray.</span></span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="Mark.13.7"><span class="verse-num">7&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> &ldquo;And, when you hear of wars and rumours of wars, do not be alarmed; such things must occur; but the end is not yet.</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Mark.13.8"><span class="verse-num">8&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> For &lsquo;nation will rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom&rsquo;; there will be earthquakes in various places; there will be famines. This will be but the beginning of the birth-pangs.</span></span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="Mark.13.9"><span class="verse-num">9&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> &ldquo;See to yourselves! They will betray you to courts of law; and you will be taken to Synagogues and beaten; and you will be brought up before governors and kings for my sake, that you may bear witness before them.</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Mark.13.10"><span class="verse-num">10&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> But the Good News must first be proclaimed to every nation.</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Mark.13.11"><span class="verse-num">11&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> Whenever they betray you and hand you over for trial, do not be anxious beforehand as to what you shall say, but say whatever is given you at the moment; for it will not be you who speak, but the Holy Spirit.</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Mark.13.12"><span class="verse-num">12&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> Brother will betray brother to death, and the father his child; and children will turn against their parents, and cause them to be put to death;</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Mark.13.13"><span class="verse-num">13&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> and you will be hated by every one on account of my Name. Yet the man that endures to the end shall be saved.</span></span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="Mark.13.14"><span class="verse-num">14&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> &ldquo;As soon, however, as you see &lsquo;the Foul Desecration&rsquo; standing where he ought not&rdquo;</span>  (the reader must consider what this means) <span class="woc"> &ldquo;then those of you who are in Judea must take refuge in the mountains;</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Mark.13.15"><span class="verse-num">15&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> and a man on the house-top must not go down, or go in to get anything out of his house:</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Mark.13.16"><span class="verse-num">16&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> nor must one who is on his farm turn back to get his cloak.</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Mark.13.17"><span class="verse-num">17&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> And alas for the women that are with child, and for those that are nursing infants in those days!</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Mark.13.18"><span class="verse-num">18&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> Pray, too, that this may not occur in winter.</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Mark.13.19"><span class="verse-num">19&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> For those days will be a time of distress, the like of which has not occurred from the beginning of God&rsquo;s creation until now &mdash; and never will again.</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Mark.13.20"><span class="verse-num">20&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> And, had not the Lord put a limit to those days, not a single soul would escape; but, for the sake of God&rsquo;s own chosen People, he did limit them.</span></span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="Mark.13.21"><span class="verse-num">21&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> &ldquo;And at that time if any one should say to you &lsquo;Look, here is the Christ!&rsquo; &lsquo;Look, there he is!&rsquo;, do not believe it;</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Mark.13.22"><span class="verse-num">22&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> for false Christs and false Prophets will arise, and display signs and marvels, to lead astray, were it possible, even God&rsquo;s People.</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Mark.13.23"><span class="verse-num">23&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> But see that you are on your guard! I have told you all this beforehand.</span></span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="Mark.13.24"><span class="verse-num">24&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> &ldquo;In those days, after that time of distress, &lsquo;the sun will be darkened, the moon will not give her light,</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Mark.13.25"><span class="verse-num">25&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> the stars will be falling from the heavens,&rsquo; and &lsquo;the forces that are in the heavens will be convulsed.&rsquo;</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Mark.13.26"><span class="verse-num">26&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> Then will be seen the &lsquo;Son of Man coming in clouds&rsquo; with great power and glory;</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Mark.13.27"><span class="verse-num">27&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> and then he will send the angels, and gather his People from the four winds, from one end of the world to the other.</span></span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="Mark.13.28"><span class="verse-num">28&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> &ldquo;Learn the lesson taught by the fig-tree. As soon as its branches are full of sap, and it is bursting into leaf, you know that summer is near.</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Mark.13.29"><span class="verse-num">29&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> And so may you, as soon as you see these things happening, know that he is at your doors.</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Mark.13.30"><span class="verse-num">30&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> I tell you that even the present generation will not pass away, until all these things have taken place.</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Mark.13.31"><span class="verse-num">31&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> The heavens and the earth will pass away, but my words will not pass away.</span></span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="Mark.13.32"><span class="verse-num">32&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> &ldquo;But about &lsquo;That Day,&rsquo; or &lsquo;The Hour,&rsquo; no one knows &mdash; not even the angels in Heaven, nor yet the Son &mdash; but only the Father.</span></span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="Mark.13.33"><span class="verse-num">33&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> &ldquo;See that you are on the watch; for you do not know when the time will be.</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Mark.13.34"><span class="verse-num">34&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> It is like a man going on a journey, who leaves his home, puts his servants in charge &mdash; each having his special duty &mdash; and orders the porter to watch.</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Mark.13.35"><span class="verse-num">35&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> Therefore watch, for you cannot be sure when the Master of the house is coming &mdash; whether in the evening, at midnight, at daybreak, or in the morning &mdash; </span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Mark.13.36"><span class="verse-num">36&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> lest he should come suddenly and find you asleep.</span></span>
