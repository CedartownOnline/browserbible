<span class="verse 1Cor_3_1" data-osis="1Cor.3.1"><span class="verse-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span>But I, Brothers, could not speak to you as men with spiritual insight, but only as worldly-minded-mere infants in the Faith of Christ.</span>
<span class="verse 1Cor_3_2" data-osis="1Cor.3.2"><span class="verse-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span>I fed you with milk, not with solid food, for you were not then able to take it. No, and even now you are not able; you are still worldly.</span>
<span class="verse 1Cor_3_3" data-osis="1Cor.3.3"><span class="verse-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span>While there exist among you jealousy and party feeling, is it not true that you are worldly, and are acting merely as other men do?</span>
<span class="verse 1Cor_3_4" data-osis="1Cor.3.4"><span class="verse-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span>When one says &lsquo;I follow Paul,&rsquo; and another &lsquo;I follow Apollos,&rsquo; are not you like other men?</span>
<span class="verse 1Cor_3_5" data-osis="1Cor.3.5"><span class="verse-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span>What, I ask, is Apollos? or what is Paul? Servants through whom you were led to accept the Faith; and that only as the Lord helped each of you.</span>
<span class="verse 1Cor_3_6" data-osis="1Cor.3.6"><span class="verse-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span>I planted, and Apollos watered, but it was God who caused the growth.</span>
<span class="verse 1Cor_3_7" data-osis="1Cor.3.7"><span class="verse-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span>Therefore neither the man who plants, nor the man who waters, is of any account, but only God who causes the growth.</span>
<span class="verse 1Cor_3_8" data-osis="1Cor.3.8"><span class="verse-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span>In this the man who plants and the man who waters are one; yet each will receive his own reward in proportion to his own labor.</span>
<span class="verse 1Cor_3_9" data-osis="1Cor.3.9"><span class="verse-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span>For we are God&rsquo;s fellow workers; you are God&rsquo;s harvest field, God&rsquo;s building.</span>
<span class="verse 1Cor_3_10" data-osis="1Cor.3.10"><span class="verse-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span>In fulfillment of the charge which God had entrusted to me, I laid the foundation like a skillful master-builder; but another man is now building upon it. Let every one take care how he builds;</span>
<span class="verse 1Cor_3_11" data-osis="1Cor.3.11"><span class="verse-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span>for no man can lay any other foundation than the one already laid-Jesus Christ.</span>
<span class="verse 1Cor_3_12" data-osis="1Cor.3.12"><span class="verse-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span>Whatever is used by those who build upon this foundation, whether gold, silver, costly stones, wood, hay, or straw,</span>
<span class="verse 1Cor_3_13" data-osis="1Cor.3.13"><span class="verse-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span>the quality of each man&rsquo;s work will become known, for the Day will make it plain; because that Day is to be ushered in with fire, and the fire itself will test the quality of every man&rsquo;s work.</span>
<span class="verse 1Cor_3_14" data-osis="1Cor.3.14"><span class="verse-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span>If any man&rsquo;s work, which he has built upon that foundation, still remains, he will gain a reward.</span>
<span class="verse 1Cor_3_15" data-osis="1Cor.3.15"><span class="verse-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span>If any man&rsquo;s work is burnt up, he will suffer loss; though he himself will escape, but only as one who has passed through fire.</span>
<span class="verse 1Cor_3_16" data-osis="1Cor.3.16"><span class="verse-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span>Do not you know that you are God&rsquo;s Temple, and that God&rsquo;s Spirit has his home in you?</span>
<span class="verse 1Cor_3_17" data-osis="1Cor.3.17"><span class="verse-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span>If any one destroys the Temple of God, God will destroy him; for the Temple of God is sacred, and so also are you.</span>
<span class="verse 1Cor_3_18" data-osis="1Cor.3.18"><span class="verse-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span>Let no one deceive himself. If any one among you imagines that, as regards this world, he is a wise man, let him become a &lsquo;fool,&rsquo; that he may become wise.</span>
<span class="verse 1Cor_3_19" data-osis="1Cor.3.19"><span class="verse-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span>For in God&rsquo;s sight this world&rsquo;s wisdom is folly. Scripture tells of-&rsquo;One who catches the wise in their own craftiness,&rsquo;</span>
<span class="verse 1Cor_3_20" data-osis="1Cor.3.20"><span class="verse-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span>And it says again-&rsquo;The Lord sees how fruitless are the deliberations of the wise.&rsquo;</span>
<span class="verse 1Cor_3_21" data-osis="1Cor.3.21"><span class="verse-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span>Therefore let no one boast about men; for all things are yours &mdash;</span>
<span class="verse 1Cor_3_22" data-osis="1Cor.3.22"><span class="verse-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span>Whether Paul, or Apollos, or Kephas, or the world, or life, or death, or the present, or the future-all things are yours!</span>
<span class="verse 1Cor_3_23" data-osis="1Cor.3.23"><span class="verse-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span>But you are Christ&rsquo;s and Christ is God&rsquo;s.</span>
