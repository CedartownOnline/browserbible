<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.19.1"><span class="verse-num verse-1">1&nbsp;</span>Jesus entered Jericho and made his way through the town.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.19.2"><span class="verse-num">2&nbsp;</span>There was a man there, known by the name of Zacchaeus, who was a commissioner of taxes and a rich man.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.19.3"><span class="verse-num">3&nbsp;</span>He tried to see what Jesus was like; but, being short, he was unable to do so because of the crowd.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.19.4"><span class="verse-num">4&nbsp;</span>So he ran on ahead and climbed into a mulberry tree, to see Jesus, for he knew that he must pass that way.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.19.5"><span class="verse-num">5&nbsp;</span>When Jesus came to the place, he looked up and said to him: <span class="woc"> &ldquo;Zacchaeus, be quick and come down, for I must stop at your house to-day.&rdquo;</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.19.6"><span class="verse-num">6&nbsp;</span>So Zacchaeus got down quickly, and joyfully welcomed him.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.19.7"><span class="verse-num">7&nbsp;</span>On seeing this, every one began to complain: &ldquo;He has gone to stay with a man who is an outcast.&rdquo;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.19.8"><span class="verse-num">8&nbsp;</span>But Zacchaeus stood forward and said to the Master: &ldquo;Listen, Master! I will give half my property to the poor, and, if I have defrauded any one of anything, I will give him back four times as much.&rdquo;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.19.9"><span class="verse-num">9&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> &ldquo;Salvation has come to this house to-day,&rdquo;</span>  answered Jesus, <span class="woc"> &ldquo;for even this man is a son of Abraham.</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.19.10"><span class="verse-num">10&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> The Son of Man has come to &lsquo;search for those who are lost&rsquo; and to save them.&rdquo;</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.19.11"><span class="verse-num">11&nbsp;</span>As the people were listening to this, Jesus went on to tell them a parable. He did so because he was near Jerusalem, and because they thought that the Kingdom of God was going to be proclaimed at once.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.19.12"><span class="verse-num">12&nbsp;</span>He said: <span class="woc"> &ldquo;A nobleman once went to a distant country to receive his appointment to a Kingdom and then return.</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.19.13"><span class="verse-num">13&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> He called ten of his servants and gave them ten pounds each, and told them to trade with them during his absence.</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.19.14"><span class="verse-num">14&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> But his subjects hated him and sent envoys after him to say &lsquo;We will not have this man as our King.&rsquo;</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.19.15"><span class="verse-num">15&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> On his return, after having been appointed King, he directed that the servants to whom he had given his money should be summoned, so that he might learn what amount of trade they had done.</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.19.16"><span class="verse-num">16&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> The first came up, and said &lsquo;Sir, your ten pounds have made a hundred.&rsquo;</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.19.17"><span class="verse-num">17&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> &lsquo;Well done, good servant!&rsquo; exclaimed the master. &lsquo;As you have proved trustworthy in a very small matter, I appoint you governor over ten towns.&rsquo;</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.19.18"><span class="verse-num">18&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> When the second came, he said &lsquo;Your ten pounds, Sir, have produced fifty.&rsquo;</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.19.19"><span class="verse-num">19&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> So the master said to him &lsquo;And you I appoint over five towns.&rsquo;</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.19.20"><span class="verse-num">20&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> Another servant also came and said &lsquo;Sir, here are your ten pounds; I have kept them put away in a handkerchief.</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.19.21"><span class="verse-num">21&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> For I was afraid of you, because you are a stern man. You take what you have not planted, and reap what you have not sown.&rsquo;</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.19.22"><span class="verse-num">22&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> The master answered &lsquo;Out of your own mouth I judge you, you worthless servant. You knew that I am a stern man, that I take what I have not planted, and reap what I have not sown?</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.19.23"><span class="verse-num">23&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> Then why did not you put my money into a bank? And I, on my return, could have claimed it with interest.</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.19.24"><span class="verse-num">24&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> Take away from him the ten pounds,&rsquo; he said to those standing by, &lsquo;and give them to the one who has the hundred.&rsquo;</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.19.25"><span class="verse-num">25&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> &lsquo;But, Sir,&rsquo; they interposed, &lsquo;he has a hundred pounds already!&rsquo;</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.19.26"><span class="verse-num">26&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> &lsquo;I tell you,&rsquo; he answered, &lsquo;that, to him who has, more will be given, but, from him who has nothing, even what he has will be taken away.</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.19.27"><span class="verse-num">27&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> But as for my enemies, these men who would not have me as their King, bring them here and put them to death in my presence.&rsquo;&rdquo;</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.19.28"><span class="verse-num">28&nbsp;</span>After saying this, Jesus went on in front, going up to Jerusalem.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.19.29"><span class="verse-num">29&nbsp;</span>It was when Jesus had almost reached Bethphage and Bethany, near the Mount of Olives, that he sent on two of the disciples.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.19.30"><span class="verse-num">30&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> &ldquo;Go to the village facing us,&rdquo;</span>  he said, <span class="woc"> &ldquo; and, when you get there, you will find a foal tethered, which no one has yet ridden; untie it and lead it here.</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.19.31"><span class="verse-num">31&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> And, if anybody asks you &lsquo;Why are you untying it?,&rsquo; you are to say this &mdash; &lsquo;The Master wants it.&rsquo;&rdquo;</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.19.32"><span class="verse-num">32&nbsp;</span>So the two who were sent went and found it as Jesus had told them.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.19.33"><span class="verse-num">33&nbsp;</span>While they were untying the foal, the owners asked them &mdash; &ldquo;Why are you untying the foal?&rdquo;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.19.34"><span class="verse-num">34&nbsp;</span>And the two disciples answered &mdash; &ldquo;The Master wants it.&rdquo;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.19.35"><span class="verse-num">35&nbsp;</span>Then they led it back to Jesus, and threw their cloaks on the foal and put Jesus upon it.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.19.36"><span class="verse-num">36&nbsp;</span>As he went along, the people kept spreading their cloaks in the road.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.19.37"><span class="verse-num">37&nbsp;</span>When he had almost reached the place where the road led down the Mount of Olives, every one of the many disciples began in their joy to praise God loudly for all the miracles that they had seen:</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.19.38"><span class="verse-num">38&nbsp;</span>&ldquo;Blessed is He who comes &mdash; Our King &mdash; in the name of the Lord! Peace in Heaven, And glory on high.&rdquo;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.19.39"><span class="verse-num">39&nbsp;</span>Some of the Pharisees in the crowd said to him: &ldquo;Teacher, reprove your disciples.&rdquo;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.19.40"><span class="verse-num">40&nbsp;</span>But Jesus answered: <span class="woc"> &ldquo;I tell you that if these men are silent, the very stones will call out.&rdquo;</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.19.41"><span class="verse-num">41&nbsp;</span>When he drew near, on seeing the city, he wept over it, and said:</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.19.42"><span class="verse-num">42&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> &ldquo;Would that you had known, while yet there was time &mdash; even you &mdash; the things that make for peace! But now they have been hidden from your sight.</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.19.43"><span class="verse-num">43&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> For a time is coming upon you when your enemies will surround you with earthworks, and encircle you, and hem you in on all sides;</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.19.44"><span class="verse-num">44&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> they will trample you down and your children within you, and they will not leave in you one stone upon another, because you did not know &lsquo;the time of your visitation.&rsquo;&rdquo;</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.19.45"><span class="verse-num">45&nbsp;</span>Jesus went into the Temple Courts and began to drive out those who were selling,</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.19.46"><span class="verse-num">46&nbsp;</span>saying as he did so: <span class="woc"> &ldquo;Scripture says &mdash; &lsquo;My House shall be a House of Prayer&rsquo;; but you have made it &lsquo;a den of robbers.&rsquo;&rdquo;</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.19.47"><span class="verse-num">47&nbsp;</span>Jesus continued to teach each day in the Temple Courts; but the Chief Priests and Teachers of the Law were eager to take his life, and so also were the leading men.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.19.48"><span class="verse-num">48&nbsp;</span>Yet they could not see what to do, for the people all hung upon his words.</span>
