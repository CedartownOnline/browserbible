<span class="verse" data-osis="Titus.2.1"><span class="verse-num verse-1">1&nbsp;</span>Do you, however, speak of such subjects as properly have a place in sound Christian teaching.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Titus.2.2"><span class="verse-num">2&nbsp;</span>Teach that the older men should be temperate, serious, and discreet; strong in faith, love, and endurance.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Titus.2.3"><span class="verse-num">3&nbsp;</span>So, too, that the older women should be reverent in their demeanour, and that they should avoid scandal, and beware of becoming slaves to drink;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Titus.2.4"><span class="verse-num">4&nbsp;</span>that they should teach what is right, so as to train the younger women to love their husbands and children,</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Titus.2.5"><span class="verse-num">5&nbsp;</span>and to be discreet, pure-minded, domesticated, good women, ready to submit to their husbands, in order that God&rsquo;s Message may not be maligned.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Titus.2.6"><span class="verse-num">6&nbsp;</span>And so again with the younger men &mdash; impress upon them the need of discretion.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Titus.2.7"><span class="verse-num">7&nbsp;</span>Above all, set an example of doing good. Show sincerity in your teaching, and a serious spirit;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Titus.2.8"><span class="verse-num">8&nbsp;</span>let the instruction that you give be sound and above reproach, so that the enemy may be ashamed when he fails to find anything bad to say about us.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Titus.2.9"><span class="verse-num">9&nbsp;</span>Urge slaves to be submissive to their owners in all circumstances, and to try their best to please them.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Titus.2.10"><span class="verse-num">10&nbsp;</span>Teach them not to contradict or to pilfer, but to show such praiseworthy fidelity in everything, as to recommend the teaching about God our Saviour by all that they do.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Titus.2.11"><span class="verse-num">11&nbsp;</span>For the loving-kindness of God has been revealed, bringing Salvation for all;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Titus.2.12"><span class="verse-num">12&nbsp;</span>leading us to renounce irreligious ways and worldly ambitions, and to live discreet, upright, and religious lives here in this present world,</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Titus.2.13"><span class="verse-num">13&nbsp;</span>while we are awaiting our Blessed Hope &mdash; the Appearing in glory of our great God and Saviour, Christ Jesus.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Titus.2.14"><span class="verse-num">14&nbsp;</span>For he gave himself on our behalf, to deliver us from all wickedness, and to purify for himself a People who should be peculiarly his own and eager to do good.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Titus.2.15"><span class="verse-num">15&nbsp;</span>Speak of all this, and encourage and rebuke with all authority. Do not let any one despise you.</span>
