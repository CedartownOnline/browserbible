<span class="verse" data-osis="1Tim.3.1"><span class="verse-num verse-1">1&nbsp;</span>How true is that saying! When a man aspires to be a Presiding-Officer in the Church, he is ambitious for a noble task.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="1Tim.3.2"><span class="verse-num">2&nbsp;</span>The Presiding-Officer should be a man of blameless character; a faithful husband; living a temperate, discreet, and well-ordered life; hospitable, and a skilful teacher,</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="1Tim.3.3"><span class="verse-num">3&nbsp;</span>not addicted to drink or brawling, but of a forbearing and peaceable disposition, and not a lover of money;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="1Tim.3.4"><span class="verse-num">4&nbsp;</span>he should be a man who rules his own household well, and whose children are kept under control and are well-behaved.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="1Tim.3.5"><span class="verse-num">5&nbsp;</span>If a man does not know how to rule his own household, how can he take charge of the Church of God?</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="1Tim.3.6"><span class="verse-num">6&nbsp;</span>The Presiding-Officer should not be a recent convert, that he may not be blinded by pride and fall under the same condemnation as the Devil.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="1Tim.3.7"><span class="verse-num">7&nbsp;</span>He should also be well spoken of by outsiders, that he may not incur censure and so fall into the snares of the Devil.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="1Tim.3.8"><span class="verse-num">8&nbsp;</span>So, too, Assistant-Officers should be serious and straightforward men, not given to taking much drink or to questionable money-making,</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="1Tim.3.9"><span class="verse-num">9&nbsp;</span>but men who hold the deep truths of the Faith and have a clear conscience.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="1Tim.3.10"><span class="verse-num">10&nbsp;</span>They should be tested first, and only appointed to their Office if no objection is raised against them.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="1Tim.3.11"><span class="verse-num">11&nbsp;</span>It should be the same with the women. They should be serious, not gossips, sober, and trustworthy in all respects.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="1Tim.3.12"><span class="verse-num">12&nbsp;</span>Assistant-Officers should be faithful husbands, and men who rule their children and their households well.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="1Tim.3.13"><span class="verse-num">13&nbsp;</span>Those who have filled that post with honour gain for themselves an honourable position, as well as great confidence through the faith that they place in Christ Jesus.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="1Tim.3.14"><span class="verse-num">14&nbsp;</span>I am writing this to you, though I hope that I shall come to see you before long;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="1Tim.3.15"><span class="verse-num">15&nbsp;</span>but in case I should be delayed, I want you to know what your conduct ought to be in the Household of God, which is the Church of the Living God &mdash; the pillar and stay of the Truth.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="1Tim.3.16"><span class="verse-num">16&nbsp;</span>Yes, and confessedly wonderful are the deep truths of our religion; for &mdash;  &lsquo;He was revealed in our nature, pronounced righteous in spirit, seen by angels, proclaimed among the Gentiles, believed on in the world, taken up into glory.&rsquo;</span>
