<h3>The Revelation to John</h3>
<h2 class="chapter-num">1</h2>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="Rev.1.1"><span class="verse-num verse-1">1&nbsp;</span>The Revelation of Jesus Christ, which God gave to him to make known to his servants, concerning what must shortly take place, and which he sent and revealed by his angel to his servant John,</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Rev.1.2"><span class="verse-num">2&nbsp;</span>who testified to the Message of God and to the testimony to Jesus Christ, omitting nothing of what he had seen.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Rev.1.3"><span class="verse-num">3&nbsp;</span>Blessed is he who reads, and blessed are they who listen to, the words of this prophecy, and lay to heart what is here written; for The Time is near.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Rev.1.4"><span class="verse-num">4&nbsp;</span>From John, to the seven Churches which are in Roman Asia. Blessing and peace be yours from him who is, and who was, and who shall be, and from the seven Spirits that are before his throne,</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Rev.1.5"><span class="verse-num">5&nbsp;</span>and from Jesus Christ, &lsquo; the faithful Witness, the First-born from the dead, and the Ruler of all the Kings of the earth.&rsquo; To him who loves us and freed us from our sins by his own blood &mdash;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Rev.1.6"><span class="verse-num">6&nbsp;</span>and he made us &lsquo; a Kingdom of Priests in the service of God,&rsquo; his Father !  &mdash; to Him be ascribed glory and dominion for ever. Amen.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Rev.1.7"><span class="verse-num">7&nbsp;</span>&lsquo;He is coming among the clouds!&rsquo; Every eye shall see him, even those who pierced him; &lsquo;and all the nations of the earth shall wail for fear of him.&rsquo; So shall it be. Amen.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Rev.1.8"><span class="verse-num">8&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> &lsquo;I am the Alpha and the Omega,&rsquo;</span>  says the Lord, <span class="woc"> the God who is, and who was, and who shall be, the Almighty.</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Rev.1.9"><span class="verse-num">9&nbsp;</span>I, John, who am your Brother, and who share with you in the suffering and kingship and endurance of Jesus, found myself on the island called Patmos, for the sake of the Message of God and the testimony to Jesus.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Rev.1.10"><span class="verse-num">10&nbsp;</span>I fell into a trance on the Lord&rsquo;s Day, and I heard behind me a loud voice, like the blast of a trumpet.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Rev.1.11"><span class="verse-num">11&nbsp;</span>It said &mdash;  <span class="woc"> &lsquo;Write what you see in a book and send it to the seven Churches, to Ephesus, Smyrna, Pergamus, Thyatira, Sardis, Philadelphia, and Laodicaea.&rsquo;</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Rev.1.12"><span class="verse-num">12&nbsp;</span>I turned to see what voice it was that spoke to me; and when I turned, I saw seven golden lamps,</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Rev.1.13"><span class="verse-num">13&nbsp;</span>and in the midst of the lamps one &lsquo;like a man, in a robe reaching to his feet,&rsquo; and with a golden girdle across his breast.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Rev.1.14"><span class="verse-num">14&nbsp;</span>&lsquo;The hair of his head was as white as wool, as white as snow; his eyes were like flaming fire;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Rev.1.15"><span class="verse-num">15&nbsp;</span>and his feet were like brass&rsquo; as when molten in a furnace; &lsquo;his voice was like the sound of many streams,&rsquo;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Rev.1.16"><span class="verse-num">16&nbsp;</span>in his right hand he held seven stars, from his mouth came a sharp two-edged sword, and his face was like &lsquo;the sun in the fulness of its power.&rsquo;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Rev.1.17"><span class="verse-num">17&nbsp;</span>And, when I saw him, I fell at his feet like one dead. He laid his hand on me and said &mdash;  <span class="woc"> &lsquo;Do not be afraid. I am the First and the Last,</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Rev.1.18"><span class="verse-num">18&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> the Everliving. I died, and I am alive for ever and ever. And I hold the keys of the Grave and of the Place of the Dead.</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Rev.1.19"><span class="verse-num">19&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> Therefore write of what you have seen and of what is happening now and of what is about to take place &mdash; </span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Rev.1.20"><span class="verse-num">20&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> the mystic meaning of the seven stars which you saw in my right hand, and the seven golden lamps. The seven stars are the Angels of the seven Churches, and the seven lamps are the seven Churches.</span></span>
