<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.9.1"><span class="verse-num verse-1">1&nbsp;</span>Jesus called the Twelve together, and gave them power and authority over all demons, as well as to cure diseases.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.9.2"><span class="verse-num">2&nbsp;</span>He sent them out as his Messengers, to proclaim the Kingdom of God, and to work cures.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.9.3"><span class="verse-num">3&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> &ldquo;Do not,&rdquo;</span>  he said to them, <span class="woc"> &ldquo;take anything for your journey; not even a staff, or a bag, or bread, or any silver, or a change of clothes with you.</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.9.4"><span class="verse-num">4&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> Whatever house you go to stay in, remain there, and leave from that place.</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.9.5"><span class="verse-num">5&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> If people do not welcome you, as you leave that town, shake even the dust off your feet, as a protest against them.&rdquo;</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.9.6"><span class="verse-num">6&nbsp;</span>Then they set out and went from village to village, telling the Good News and curing people everywhere.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.9.7"><span class="verse-num">7&nbsp;</span>Prince Herod heard of all that was happening, and was perplexed, because it was said by some that John must be risen from the dead.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.9.8"><span class="verse-num">8&nbsp;</span>Some again said that Elijah had appeared, and others that one of the old Prophets had risen again.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.9.9"><span class="verse-num">9&nbsp;</span>But Herod himself said: &ldquo;John I beheaded; but who is this of whom I hear such things?&rdquo; And he endeavoured to see him.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.9.10"><span class="verse-num">10&nbsp;</span>When the Apostles returned, they related to Jesus all that they had done. Then Jesus retired privately to a town called Bethsaida, taking the Apostles with him.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.9.11"><span class="verse-num">11&nbsp;</span>But the people recognised him and followed him in crowds; and Jesus welcomed them and spoke to them about the Kingdom of God, while he cured those who were in need of help.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.9.12"><span class="verse-num">12&nbsp;</span>The day was drawing to a close, when the twelve came up to him, and said: &ldquo;Send the crowd away, so that they may make their way to the villages and farms round about, and find themselves lodgings and provisions, for we are in a lonely spot here.&rdquo;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.9.13"><span class="verse-num">13&nbsp;</span>But Jesus said: <span class="woc"> &ldquo;It is for you to give them something to eat.&rdquo;</span>  &ldquo;We have not more than five loaves and two fishes,&rdquo; they answered; &ldquo;unless indeed we are to go and buy food for all these people.&rdquo;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.9.14"><span class="verse-num">14&nbsp;</span>(For the men among them were about five thousand.) <span class="woc"> &ldquo;Get them seated in companies,&rdquo;</span>  was his reply, <span class="woc"> &ldquo;about fifty in each.&rdquo;</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.9.15"><span class="verse-num">15&nbsp;</span>This they did, and got all the people seated.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.9.16"><span class="verse-num">16&nbsp;</span>Taking the five loaves and the two fishes, Jesus looked up to Heaven and said the blessing over them. Then he broke them in pieces, and gave them to his disciples to set before the people.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.9.17"><span class="verse-num">17&nbsp;</span>Every one had sufficient to eat, and what was left of the broken pieces was picked up &mdash; twelve baskets.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.9.18"><span class="verse-num">18&nbsp;</span>Afterwards, when Jesus was alone, praying, his disciples joined him, and he asked them this question &mdash; <span class="woc"> &ldquo;Who do the people say that I am?&rdquo;</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.9.19"><span class="verse-num">19&nbsp;</span>&ldquo;John the Baptist,&rdquo; was their answer; &ldquo;others, however, say that you are Elijah, while others say that one of the old Prophets has risen again.&rdquo;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.9.20"><span class="verse-num">20&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> &ldquo;But you,&rdquo;</span>  he went on, <span class="woc"> &ldquo;who do you say that I am?&rdquo;</span>  And to this Peter answered: &ldquo;The Christ of God.&rdquo;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.9.21"><span class="verse-num">21&nbsp;</span>Jesus, however, strictly charged them not to say this to any one;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.9.22"><span class="verse-num">22&nbsp;</span>he told them that the Son of Man must undergo much suffering, and be rejected by the Councillors, and Chief Priests, and Teachers of the Law, and be put to death, and rise on the third day.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.9.23"><span class="verse-num">23&nbsp;</span>And to all present he said: <span class="woc"> &ldquo;If any man wishes to walk in my steps, let him renounce self, and take up his cross daily, and follow me.</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.9.24"><span class="verse-num">24&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> For whoever wishes to save his life will lose it, and whoever, for my sake, loses his life &mdash; that man shall save it.</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.9.25"><span class="verse-num">25&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> What good does it do a man if, when he has gained the whole world, he has lost or forfeited himself?</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.9.26"><span class="verse-num">26&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> Whoever is ashamed of me and of my teaching, the Son of Man will be ashamed of him, when he comes in his Glory and the Glory of the father and of the holy angels.</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.9.27"><span class="verse-num">27&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> Indeed, I tell you, some who are standing before me will not know death, till they have seen the Kingdom of God.&rdquo;</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.9.28"><span class="verse-num">28&nbsp;</span>About eight days after speaking these words, Jesus went up the mountain to pray, taking with him Peter, John, and James.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.9.29"><span class="verse-num">29&nbsp;</span>As he was praying, the aspect of his face was changed, and his clothing became of a glittering whiteness.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.9.30"><span class="verse-num">30&nbsp;</span>And all at once two men were talking with Jesus; they were Moses and Elijah,</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.9.31"><span class="verse-num">31&nbsp;</span>who appeared in a glorified state, and spoke of his departure, which was destined to take place at Jerusalem.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.9.32"><span class="verse-num">32&nbsp;</span>Peter and his companions had been overpowered by sleep but, suddenly becoming wide awake, they saw Jesus glorified and the two men who were standing beside him.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.9.33"><span class="verse-num">33&nbsp;</span>And, as Moses and Elijah were passing away from Jesus, Peter exclaimed: &ldquo;Sir, it is good to be here; let us make three tents, one for you, and one for Moses, and one for Elijah.&rdquo; He did not know what he was saying;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.9.34"><span class="verse-num">34&nbsp;</span>and, while he was speaking, a cloud came down and enveloped them; and they were afraid, as they passed into the cloud;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.9.35"><span class="verse-num">35&nbsp;</span>and from the cloud came a voice which said &mdash; &ldquo;This is my Son, the Chosen One; him you must hear.&rdquo;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.9.36"><span class="verse-num">36&nbsp;</span>And, as the voice ceased, Jesus was found alone. The Apostles kept silence, and told no one about any of the things that they had seen.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.9.37"><span class="verse-num">37&nbsp;</span>The next day, when they had come down from the mountain, a great crowd met Jesus.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.9.38"><span class="verse-num">38&nbsp;</span>And just then a man in the crowd shouted out: &ldquo;Teacher, I entreat you to look at my son, for he is my only child;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.9.39"><span class="verse-num">39&nbsp;</span>all at once a spirit will seize him, suddenly shriek out, and throw him into convulsions till he foams, and will leave him only when he is utterly exhausted.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.9.40"><span class="verse-num">40&nbsp;</span>I entreated your disciples to drive the spirit out, but they could not.&rdquo;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.9.41"><span class="verse-num">41&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> &ldquo;O faithless and perverse generation!&rdquo;</span>  Jesus exclaimed; <span class="woc"> &ldquo;how long must I be with you and have patience with you? Lead your son here.&rdquo;</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.9.42"><span class="verse-num">42&nbsp;</span>While the boy was coming up to Jesus, the demon dashed him down and threw him into convulsions. But Jesus rebuked the foul spirit, and cured the boy, and gave him back to his father.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.9.43"><span class="verse-num">43&nbsp;</span>And all present were struck with awe at the majesty of God. In the midst of the general astonishment at all that Jesus was doing, he said to his disciples:</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.9.44"><span class="verse-num">44&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> &ldquo;Listen carefully to my words. For the Son of Man is destined to be betrayed into the hands of his fellow men.&rdquo;</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.9.45"><span class="verse-num">45&nbsp;</span>But the disciples did not understand the meaning of this; it had been concealed from them so that they did not see it, and they were afraid to question him as to what he meant.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.9.46"><span class="verse-num">46&nbsp;</span>A discussion arose among the disciples as to which of them was the greatest;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.9.47"><span class="verse-num">47&nbsp;</span>and Jesus, knowing of the discussion that was occupying their thoughts, took hold of a little child, and placed it beside him,</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.9.48"><span class="verse-num">48&nbsp;</span>and then said to them: <span class="woc"> &ldquo;Any one who, for the sake of my Name, welcomes even this little child is welcoming me; and any one who welcomes me is welcoming him who sent me as his Messenger. For whoever is lowliest among you all &mdash; that man is great.&rdquo;</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.9.49"><span class="verse-num">49&nbsp;</span>Thereupon John said: &ldquo;Sir, we saw a man driving out demons by using your name, and we tried to prevent him, because he does not follow you with us.&rdquo;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.9.50"><span class="verse-num">50&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> &ldquo;None of you must prevent him,&rdquo;</span>  Jesus said to John; <span class="woc"> &ldquo;he who is not against you is for you.&rdquo;</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.9.51"><span class="verse-num">51&nbsp;</span>As the days before his being taken up to Heaven were growing few, Jesus set his face resolutely in the direction of Jerusalem; and he sent on messengers in advance.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.9.52"><span class="verse-num">52&nbsp;</span>On their way, they went into a Samaritan village to make preparations for him,</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.9.53"><span class="verse-num">53&nbsp;</span>but the people there did not welcome him, because his face was set in the direction of Jerusalem.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.9.54"><span class="verse-num">54&nbsp;</span>When James and John saw this, they said: &ldquo;Master, do you wish us to call for fire to come down from the heavens and consume them?&rdquo;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.9.55"><span class="verse-num">55&nbsp;</span>But Jesus turned and rebuked them.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.9.56"><span class="verse-num">56&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> And they made their way to another village.</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.9.57"><span class="verse-num">57&nbsp;</span>And, while they were on their way, a man said to Jesus: &ldquo;I will follow you wherever you go.&rdquo;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.9.58"><span class="verse-num">58&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> &ldquo;Foxes have holes,&rdquo;</span>  he replied, <span class="woc"> &ldquo;and wild birds their roosting-places, but the Son of Man has nowhere to lay his head.&rdquo;</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.9.59"><span class="verse-num">59&nbsp;</span>To another man Jesus said: <span class="woc"> &ldquo;Follow me.&rdquo;</span>  &ldquo;Let me first go and bury my father,&rdquo; said the man.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.9.60"><span class="verse-num">60&nbsp;</span>But Jesus said: <span class="woc"> &ldquo;Leave the dead to bury their dead; but go yourself and carry far and wide the news of the Kingdom of God.&rdquo;</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.9.61"><span class="verse-num">61&nbsp;</span>&ldquo;Master,&rdquo; said another, &ldquo;I will follow you; but first let me say good-bye to my family.&rdquo;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.9.62"><span class="verse-num">62&nbsp;</span>But Jesus answered: <span class="woc"> &ldquo;No one who looks back, after putting his hand to the plough, is fitted for the Kingdom of God.&rdquo;</span></span>
