<span class="verse" data-osis="Rev.8.1"><span class="verse-num verse-1">1&nbsp;</span>As soon as the Lamb had broken the seventh seal, there was silence in Heaven for, it might be, half-an-hour.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Rev.8.2"><span class="verse-num">2&nbsp;</span>Then I saw the seven angels who stand before God, and seven trumpets were given to them.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Rev.8.3"><span class="verse-num">3&nbsp;</span>Next, another angel came and stood at the altar with a golden censer in his hand; and a great quantity of incense was given to him, to mingle with the prayers of all Christ&rsquo;s People upon the golden altar before the throne.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Rev.8.4"><span class="verse-num">4&nbsp;</span>The smoke of the incense ascended, with the prayers of Christ&rsquo;s People, from the hand of the angel before God.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Rev.8.5"><span class="verse-num">5&nbsp;</span>Then the angel took the censer, and filled it with fire from the altar, and threw it down upon the earth; and there followed &lsquo;peals of thunder, cries, flashes of lightning,&rsquo; and an earthquake.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Rev.8.6"><span class="verse-num">6&nbsp;</span>Then the seven angels holding the seven trumpets prepared to blow their blasts.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Rev.8.7"><span class="verse-num">7&nbsp;</span>The first blew; and there came hail and fire mixed with blood, and it fell upon the earth. A third part of the earth was burnt up, and a third of the trees, and every blade of grass.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Rev.8.8"><span class="verse-num">8&nbsp;</span>Then the second angel blew; and what appeared to be a great mountain, burning, was hurled into the sea. A third of the sea became blood,</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Rev.8.9"><span class="verse-num">9&nbsp;</span>and a third part of all created things that are in the sea &mdash; that is, of all living things &mdash; died, and a third of the ships was destroyed.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Rev.8.10"><span class="verse-num">10&nbsp;</span>Then the third angel blew; and there fell from the heavens a great star, burning like a torch. It fell upon a third of the rivers and upon the springs.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Rev.8.11"><span class="verse-num">11&nbsp;</span>(The star is called &lsquo;Wormwood.&rsquo;) A third of the water became bitter as wormwood, and so bitter was the water that many died from drinking it.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Rev.8.12"><span class="verse-num">12&nbsp;</span>Then the fourth angel blew; and a third of the sun and a third of the moon and a third of the stars were blasted, so that a third of them was eclipsed, and for a third part of the day there was no light, and at night it was the same.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Rev.8.13"><span class="verse-num">13&nbsp;</span>And, in my vision, I heard an eagle flying in mid-heaven and crying in a loud voice &mdash; &lsquo;Woe, woe, woe for all who live on the earth, at the other trumpet-blasts of the three angels who have yet to blow.&rsquo;</span>
