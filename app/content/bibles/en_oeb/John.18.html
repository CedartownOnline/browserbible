<span class="verse" data-osis="John.18.1"><span class="verse-num verse-1">1&nbsp;</span>When Jesus had said this, he went out with his disciples and crossed the brook Kedron to a place where there was a garden, into which he and his disciples went.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.18.2"><span class="verse-num">2&nbsp;</span>The place was well known to Judas, the betrayer, for Jesus and his disciples had often met there.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.18.3"><span class="verse-num">3&nbsp;</span>So Judas, who had obtained the soldiers of the Roman garrison, and some police-officers from the Chief Priests and the Pharisees, came there with lanterns, torches, and weapons.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.18.4"><span class="verse-num">4&nbsp;</span>Jesus, aware of all that was coming upon him, went to meet them, and said to them: <span class="woc"> &ldquo;For whom are you looking?&rdquo;</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.18.5"><span class="verse-num">5&nbsp;</span>&ldquo;Jesus of Nazareth,&rdquo; was their answer. <span class="woc"> &ldquo;I am he,&rdquo;</span>  said Jesus. (Judas, the betrayer, was also standing with them.)</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.18.6"><span class="verse-num">6&nbsp;</span>When Jesus said <span class="woc"> &lsquo;I am he,&rsquo;</span>  they drew back and fell to the ground.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.18.7"><span class="verse-num">7&nbsp;</span>So he again asked for whom they were looking, and they answered: &ldquo;Jesus of Nazareth.&rdquo;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.18.8"><span class="verse-num">8&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> &ldquo;I have already told you that I am he,&rdquo;</span>  replied Jesus, <span class="woc"> &ldquo;so, if it is for me that you are looking, let these men go.&rdquo;</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.18.9"><span class="verse-num">9&nbsp;</span>This was in fulfilment of his words &mdash; <span class="woc"> &lsquo;Of those whom thou hast given me I have not lost one.&rsquo;</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.18.10"><span class="verse-num">10&nbsp;</span>At this, Simon Peter, who had a sword with him, drew it, and struck the High Priest&rsquo;s servant, and cut off his right ear. The servant&rsquo;s name was Malchus.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.18.11"><span class="verse-num">11&nbsp;</span>But Jesus said to Peter: <span class="woc"> &ldquo;Sheathe your sword. Shall I not drink the cup which the Father has given me?&rdquo;</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.18.12"><span class="verse-num">12&nbsp;</span>So the soldiers of the garrison, with their Commanding Officer and the Jewish police, arrested Jesus and bound him,</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.18.13"><span class="verse-num">13&nbsp;</span>and took him first of all to Annas. Annas was the father-in- law of Caiaphas, who was High Priest that year.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.18.14"><span class="verse-num">14&nbsp;</span>It was Caiaphas who had counselled the Jews, that it was best that one man should die for the people.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.18.15"><span class="verse-num">15&nbsp;</span>Meanwhile Simon Peter followed Jesus, and so did another disciple. That disciple, being well-known to the High Priest, went with Jesus into the High Priest&rsquo;s court-yard,</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.18.16"><span class="verse-num">16&nbsp;</span>while Peter stood outside by the door. Presently the other disciple &mdash; the one well-known to the High Priest &mdash; went out and spoke to the portress, and brought Peter in.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.18.17"><span class="verse-num">17&nbsp;</span>So the maidservant said to Peter: &ldquo;Are not you also one of this man&rsquo;s disciples?&rdquo; &ldquo;No, I am not,&rdquo; he said.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.18.18"><span class="verse-num">18&nbsp;</span>The servants and police-officers were standing round a char- coal fire (which they had made because it was cold), and were warming themselves. Peter, too, was with them, standing and warming himself.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.18.19"><span class="verse-num">19&nbsp;</span>The High Priest questioned Jesus about his disciples and about his teaching.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.18.20"><span class="verse-num">20&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> &ldquo;For my part,&rdquo;</span>  answered Jesus, <span class="woc"> &ldquo;I have spoken to all the world openly. I always taught in some Synagogue, or in the Temple Courts, places where all the Jews assemble, and I never spoke of anything in secret.</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.18.21"><span class="verse-num">21&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> Why question me? Question those who have listened to me as to what I have spoken about to them. They must know what I said.&rdquo;</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.18.22"><span class="verse-num">22&nbsp;</span>When Jesus said this, one of the police-officers, who was standing near, gave him a blow with his hand. &ldquo;Do you answer the High Priest like that?&rdquo; he exclaimed.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.18.23"><span class="verse-num">23&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> &ldquo;If I said anything wrong, give evidence about it,&rdquo;</span>  replied Jesus; <span class="woc"> &ldquo;but if not, why do you strike me?&rdquo;</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.18.24"><span class="verse-num">24&nbsp;</span>Annas sent him bound to Caiaphas the High Priest.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.18.25"><span class="verse-num">25&nbsp;</span>Meanwhile Simon Peter was standing there, warming himself; so they said to him: &ldquo;Are not you also one of his disciples?&rdquo; Peter denied it. &ldquo;No, I am not,&rdquo; he said.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.18.26"><span class="verse-num">26&nbsp;</span>One of the High Priest&rsquo;s servants, a relation of the man whose ear Peter had cut off, exclaimed: &ldquo;Did not I myself see you with him in the garden?&rdquo;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.18.27"><span class="verse-num">27&nbsp;</span>Peter again denied it; and at that moment a cock crowed.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.18.28"><span class="verse-num">28&nbsp;</span>From Caiaphas they took Jesus to the Government House. It was early in the morning. But they did not enter the Government House themselves, lest they should become &lsquo;defiled,&rsquo; and so be unable to eat the Passover.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.18.29"><span class="verse-num">29&nbsp;</span>Therefore Pilate came outside to speak to them. &ldquo;What charge do you bring against this man?&rdquo; he asked.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.18.30"><span class="verse-num">30&nbsp;</span>&ldquo;If he had not been a criminal, we should not have given him up to you,&rdquo; they answered.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.18.31"><span class="verse-num">31&nbsp;</span>&ldquo;Take him yourselves,&rdquo; said Pilate, &ldquo;and try him by your own Law.&rdquo; &ldquo;We have no power to put any one to death,&rdquo; the Jews replied- -</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.18.32"><span class="verse-num">32&nbsp;</span>In fulfilment of what Jesus had said when indicating the death that he was destined to die.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.18.33"><span class="verse-num">33&nbsp;</span>After that, Pilate went into the Government House again, and calling Jesus up, asked him: &ldquo;Are you the King of the Jews?&rdquo;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.18.34"><span class="verse-num">34&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> &ldquo;Do you ask me that yourself?&rdquo;</span>  replied Jesus, <span class="woc"> &ldquo;or did others say it to you about me?&rdquo;</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.18.35"><span class="verse-num">35&nbsp;</span>&ldquo;Do you take me for a Jew?&rdquo; was Pilate&rsquo;s answer. &ldquo;It is your own nation and the Chief Priests who have given you up to me. What have you done?&rdquo;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.18.36"><span class="verse-num">36&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> &ldquo;My kingly power,&rdquo;</span>  replied Jesus, <span class="woc"> &ldquo;is not due to this world. If it had been so, my servants would be doing their utmost to prevent my being given up to the Jews; but my kingly power is not from the world.&rdquo;</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.18.37"><span class="verse-num">37&nbsp;</span>&ldquo;So you are a King after all!&rdquo; exclaimed Pilate. <span class="woc"> &ldquo;Yes, it is true I am a King,&rdquo;</span>  answered Jesus. <span class="woc"> &ldquo;I was born for this, I have come into the world for this &mdash; to bear testimony to the Truth. Every one who is on the side of Truth listens to my voice.&rdquo;</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.18.38"><span class="verse-num">38&nbsp;</span>&ldquo;What is Truth?&rdquo; exclaimed Pilate. After saying this, he went out to the Jews again, and said: &ldquo;For my part, I find nothing with which he can be charged.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.18.39"><span class="verse-num">39&nbsp;</span>It is, however, the custom for me to grant you the release of one man at the Passover Festival. Do you wish for the release of the King of the Jews?&rdquo;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.18.40"><span class="verse-num">40&nbsp;</span>&ldquo;No, not this man,&rdquo; they shouted again, &ldquo;but Barabbas!&rdquo; This Barabbas was a robber.</span>
