<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.22.1"><span class="verse-num verse-1">1&nbsp;</span>Once more Jesus spoke to them in parables.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.22.2"><span class="verse-num">2&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> &ldquo;The Kingdom of Heaven,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;may be compared to a king who gave a banquet in honour of his son&rsquo;s wedding.</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.22.3"><span class="verse-num">3&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> He sent his servants to call those who had been invited to the banquet, but they were unwilling to come.</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.22.4"><span class="verse-num">4&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> A second time he sent some servants, with orders to say to those who had been invited &lsquo;I have prepared my breakfast, my cattle and fat beasts are killed and everything is ready; come to the banquet.&rsquo;</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.22.5"><span class="verse-num">5&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> They, however, took no notice, but went off, one to his farm, another to his business;</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.22.6"><span class="verse-num">6&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> while the rest, seizing his servants, ill-treated them and killed them.</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.22.7"><span class="verse-num">7&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> The king, in anger, sent his troops, put those murderers to death, and set their city on fire.</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.22.8"><span class="verse-num">8&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> Then he said to his servants &lsquo;The banquet is prepared, but those who were invited were not worthy.</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.22.9"><span class="verse-num">9&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> So go to the cross-roads, and invite everyone you find to the banquet.&rsquo;</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.22.10"><span class="verse-num">10&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> The servants went out into the roads and collected all the people whom they found, whether bad or good; and the bridal-hall was filled with guests.</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.22.11"><span class="verse-num">11&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> But, when the king went in to see his guests, he noticed there a man who had not put on a wedding-robe.</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.22.12"><span class="verse-num">12&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> So he said to him &lsquo;My friend, how is it that you came in here without a wedding-robe?&rsquo; The man was speechless.</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.22.13"><span class="verse-num">13&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> Then the king said to the attendants &lsquo;Tie him hand and foot, and &lsquo;put him out into the darkness&rsquo; outside, where there will be weeping and grinding of teeth.&rsquo;</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.22.14"><span class="verse-num">14&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> For many are called, but few chosen.&rdquo; </span></span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.22.15"><span class="verse-num">15&nbsp;</span>Then the Pharisees went away and conferred together as to how they might lay a snare for Jesus in the course of conversation.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.22.16"><span class="verse-num">16&nbsp;</span>They sent their disciples, with the Herodians, to say to him: &ldquo;Teacher, we know that you are an honest man, and that you teach the way of God honestly, and are not afraid of any one; for you pay no regard to a man&rsquo;s position.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.22.17"><span class="verse-num">17&nbsp;</span>Tell us, then, what you think. Are we right in paying taxes to the Emperor, or not?&rdquo;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.22.18"><span class="verse-num">18&nbsp;</span>Perceiving their malice, Jesus answered: <span class="woc"> &ldquo;Why are you testing me, you hypocrites?</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.22.19"><span class="verse-num">19&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> Show me the coin with which the tax is paid.&rdquo; </span>  And, when they had brought him a florin,</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.22.20"><span class="verse-num">20&nbsp;</span>he asked: <span class="woc"> &ldquo;Whose head and title are these?&rdquo; </span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.22.21"><span class="verse-num">21&nbsp;</span>&ldquo;The Emperor&rsquo;s,&rdquo; they answered: on which he said to them: <span class="woc"> &ldquo;Then pay to the Emperor what belongs to the Emperor, and to God what belongs to God.&rdquo; </span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.22.22"><span class="verse-num">22&nbsp;</span>They wondered at his answer, and left him alone and went away.</span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.22.23"><span class="verse-num">23&nbsp;</span>That same day some Sadducees came up to Jesus, maintaining that there is no resurrection. Their question was this: &mdash;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.22.24"><span class="verse-num">24&nbsp;</span>&ldquo;Teacher, Moses said &mdash; &rsquo;should a man die without children, the man&rsquo;s brother shall become the husband of the widow, and raise a family for his brother.&rsquo;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.22.25"><span class="verse-num">25&nbsp;</span>Now we had living among us seven brothers; of whom the eldest married and died, and, as he had no family, left his wife for his brother.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.22.26"><span class="verse-num">26&nbsp;</span>The same thing happened to the second and the third brothers, and indeed to all the seven.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.22.27"><span class="verse-num">27&nbsp;</span>The woman herself died last of all.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.22.28"><span class="verse-num">28&nbsp;</span>At the resurrection, then, whose wife will she be out of the seven, all of them having had her?&rdquo;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.22.29"><span class="verse-num">29&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> &ldquo;Your mistake,&rdquo; </span>  replied Jesus, <span class="woc"> &ldquo;is due to your ignorance of the Scriptures, and of the power of God.</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.22.30"><span class="verse-num">30&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> For at the resurrection there is no marrying or being married, but all who rise are as angels in Heaven.</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.22.31"><span class="verse-num">31&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> As to the resurrection of the dead, have you not read these words of God &mdash; </span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.22.32"><span class="verse-num">32&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> &lsquo;I am the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob&rsquo;? He is not the God of dead men, but of living.&rdquo; </span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.22.33"><span class="verse-num">33&nbsp;</span>The crowds, who had been listening to him, were greatly struck with his teaching.</span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.22.34"><span class="verse-num">34&nbsp;</span>When the Pharisees heard that Jesus had silenced the Sadducees, they collected together.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.22.35"><span class="verse-num">35&nbsp;</span>Then one of them, a Student of the Law, to test him, asked this question &mdash;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.22.36"><span class="verse-num">36&nbsp;</span>&ldquo;Teacher, what is the great commandment in the Law?&rdquo;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.22.37"><span class="verse-num">37&nbsp;</span>His answer was: <span class="woc"> &ldquo;&lsquo;Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy Heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind.&rsquo;</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.22.38"><span class="verse-num">38&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> This is the great first commandment.</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.22.39"><span class="verse-num">39&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> The second, which is like it, is this &mdash; &lsquo;Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thou dost thyself.&rsquo;</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.22.40"><span class="verse-num">40&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> On these two commandments hang all the Law and the Prophets.&rdquo; </span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.22.41"><span class="verse-num">41&nbsp;</span>Before the Pharisees separated, Jesus put this question to them &mdash;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.22.42"><span class="verse-num">42&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> &ldquo;What do you think about the Christ? Whose son is he?&rdquo; </span>  &ldquo;David&rsquo;s,&rdquo; they said.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.22.43"><span class="verse-num">43&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> &ldquo;How is it, then,&rdquo; </span>  Jesus replied, <span class="woc"> &ldquo;that David, speaking under inspiration, calls him &lsquo;lord,&rsquo; in the passage-</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.22.44"><span class="verse-num">44&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> &lsquo;The Lord said to my Lord: &ldquo;Sit at my right hand, until I put thy enemies beneath thy feet&rdquo;&rsquo;?</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.22.45"><span class="verse-num">45&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> Since, then, David calls him &lsquo;lord,&rsquo; how is he David&rsquo;s son?&rdquo; </span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.22.46"><span class="verse-num">46&nbsp;</span>No one could say a word in answer; nor did any one after that day venture to question him further.</span>
