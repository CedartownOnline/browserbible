<span class="verse" data-osis="John.6.1"><span class="verse-num verse-1">1&nbsp;</span>After this, Jesus crossed the Sea of Galilee &mdash; otherwise called the Lake of Tiberias.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.6.2"><span class="verse-num">2&nbsp;</span>A great crowd of people, however, followed him, because they saw the signs of his mission in his work among those who were afflicted.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.6.3"><span class="verse-num">3&nbsp;</span>Jesus went up the hill, and sat down there with his disciples.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.6.4"><span class="verse-num">4&nbsp;</span>It was near the time of the Jewish Festival of the Passover.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.6.5"><span class="verse-num">5&nbsp;</span>Looking up, and noticing that a great crowd was coming towards him, Jesus said to Philip: <span class="woc"> &ldquo;Where are we to buy bread for these people to eat?&rdquo;</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.6.6"><span class="verse-num">6&nbsp;</span>He said this to test him, for he himself knew what he meant to do.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.6.7"><span class="verse-num">7&nbsp;</span>&ldquo;Twenty pounds&rsquo; worth of bread,&rdquo; answered Philip, &ldquo;would not be enough for each of them to have a little.&rdquo;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.6.8"><span class="verse-num">8&nbsp;</span>&ldquo;There is a boy here,&rdquo; said Andrew, another of his disciples, Simon Peter&rsquo;s brother,</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.6.9"><span class="verse-num">9&nbsp;</span>&ldquo;Who has five barley loaves and two fishes; but what is that for so many?&rdquo;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.6.10"><span class="verse-num">10&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> &ldquo;Make the people sit down,&rdquo;</span>  said Jesus. It was a grassy spot; so the men, who numbered about five thousand, sat down,</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.6.11"><span class="verse-num">11&nbsp;</span>and then Jesus took the loaves, and, after saying the thanksgiving, distributed them to those who were sitting down; and the same with the fish, giving the people as much as they wanted.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.6.12"><span class="verse-num">12&nbsp;</span>When they were satisfied, Jesus said to his disciples: <span class="woc"> &ldquo;Collect the broken pieces that are left, so that nothing may be wasted.&rdquo;</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.6.13"><span class="verse-num">13&nbsp;</span>The disciples did so, and filled twelve baskets with the pieces of the five barley loaves, which were left after all had eaten.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.6.14"><span class="verse-num">14&nbsp;</span>When the people saw the signs which Jesus gave, they said: &ldquo;This is certainly &lsquo;the Prophet who was to come&rsquo; into the world.&rdquo;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.6.15"><span class="verse-num">15&nbsp;</span>But Jesus, having discovered that they were intending to come and carry him off to make him King, retired again up the hill, quite alone.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.6.16"><span class="verse-num">16&nbsp;</span>When evening fell, his disciples went down to the Sea,</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.6.17"><span class="verse-num">17&nbsp;</span>and, getting into a boat, began to cross to Capernaum. By this time darkness had set in, and Jesus had not yet come back to them;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.6.18"><span class="verse-num">18&nbsp;</span>the Sea, too, was getting rough, for a strong wind was blowing.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.6.19"><span class="verse-num">19&nbsp;</span>When they had rowed three or four miles, they caught sight of him walking on the water and approaching the boat, and they were frightened.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.6.20"><span class="verse-num">20&nbsp;</span>But Jesus said to them: <span class="woc"> &ldquo;It is I; do not be afraid!&rdquo;</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.6.21"><span class="verse-num">21&nbsp;</span>And after this they were glad to take him into the boat; and the boat at once arrived off the shore, for which they had been making.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.6.22"><span class="verse-num">22&nbsp;</span>The people who remained on the further side of the Sea had seen that only one boat had been there, and that Jesus had not gone into it with his disciples, but that they had left without him.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.6.23"><span class="verse-num">23&nbsp;</span>Some boats, however, had come from Tiberias, from near the spot where they had eaten the bread after the Master had said the thanksgiving.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.6.24"><span class="verse-num">24&nbsp;</span>So, on the next day, when the people saw that Jesus was not there, or his disciples either, they themselves got into the boats, and went to Capernaum to look for him.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.6.25"><span class="verse-num">25&nbsp;</span>And, when they found him on the other side of the Sea, they said: &ldquo;When did you get here, Rabbi?&rdquo;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.6.26"><span class="verse-num">26&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> &ldquo;In truth I tell you,&rdquo;</span>  answered Jesus, <span class="woc"> &ldquo;it is not on account of the signs which you saw that you are looking for me, but because you had the bread to eat and were satisfied.</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.6.27"><span class="verse-num">27&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> Work, not for the food that perishes, but for the food that lasts for Immortal Life, which the Son of Man will give you; for upon him the Father &mdash; God himself &mdash; has set the seal of his approval.&rdquo;</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.6.28"><span class="verse-num">28&nbsp;</span>&ldquo;How,&rdquo; they asked, &ldquo;are we to do the work that God would have us do?&rdquo;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.6.29"><span class="verse-num">29&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> &ldquo;The work that God would have you do,&rdquo;</span>  answered Jesus, <span class="woc"> &ldquo;is to believe in him whom God sent as his Messenger.&rdquo;</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.6.30"><span class="verse-num">30&nbsp;</span>&ldquo;What sign, then,&rdquo; they asked, &ldquo;are you giving, which we may see, and so believe you? What is the work that you are doing?</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.6.31"><span class="verse-num">31&nbsp;</span>Our ancestors had the manna to eat in the desert; as Scripture says &mdash; &lsquo;He gave them bread from Heaven to eat.&rsquo;&rdquo;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.6.32"><span class="verse-num">32&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> &ldquo;In truth I tell you,&rdquo;</span>  replied Jesus, <span class="woc"> &ldquo;Moses did not give you the Bread from Heaven, but my Father does give you the true Bread from Heaven;</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.6.33"><span class="verse-num">33&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> for the Bread that God gives is that which comes down from Heaven, and gives Life to the world.&rdquo;</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.6.34"><span class="verse-num">34&nbsp;</span>&ldquo;Master,&rdquo; they exclaimed, &ldquo;give us that Bread always!&rdquo;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.6.35"><span class="verse-num">35&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> &ldquo;I am the Life-giving Bread,&rdquo;</span>  Jesus said to them; <span class="woc"> &ldquo;he that comes to me shall never be hungry, and he that believes in me shall never thirst again.</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.6.36"><span class="verse-num">36&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> But, as I have said already, you have seen me, and yet you do not believe in me.</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.6.37"><span class="verse-num">37&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> All those whom the Father gives me will come to me; and no one who comes to me will I ever turn away.</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.6.38"><span class="verse-num">38&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> For I have come down from Heaven, to do, not my own will, but the will of him who sent me;</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.6.39"><span class="verse-num">39&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> and his will is this &mdash; that I should not lose one of all those whom he has given me, but should raise them up at the Last Day.</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.6.40"><span class="verse-num">40&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> For it is the will of my Father that every one who sees the Son, and believes in him, should have Immortal Life; and I myself will raise him up at the Last Day.&rdquo;</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.6.41"><span class="verse-num">41&nbsp;</span>Upon this the Jews began murmuring against Jesus for saying &mdash;  <span class="woc"> &lsquo;I am the Bread which came down from Heaven.&rsquo;</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.6.42"><span class="verse-num">42&nbsp;</span>&ldquo;Is not this Jesus, Joseph&rsquo;s son,&rdquo; they asked, &ldquo;whose father and mother we know? How is it that he now says that he has come down from Heaven?&rdquo;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.6.43"><span class="verse-num">43&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> &ldquo;Do not murmur among yourselves,&rdquo;</span>  said Jesus in reply.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.6.44"><span class="verse-num">44&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> &ldquo;No one can come to me, unless the Father who sent me draws him to me; and I will raise him up at the Last Day.</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.6.45"><span class="verse-num">45&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> It is said in the Prophets &mdash; &lsquo;And they shall all be taught by God.&rsquo; Every one who is taught by the Father and learns from him comes to me.</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.6.46"><span class="verse-num">46&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> Not that any one has seen the Father, except him who is from God &mdash; he has seen the Father.</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.6.47"><span class="verse-num">47&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> In truth I tell you, he who believes in me has Immortal Life.</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.6.48"><span class="verse-num">48&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> I am the Life-giving Bread.</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.6.49"><span class="verse-num">49&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> Your ancestors ate the manna in the desert, and yet died.</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.6.50"><span class="verse-num">50&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> The Bread that comes down from Heaven is such that whoever eats of it will never die.</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.6.51"><span class="verse-num">51&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> I am the Living Bread that has come down from Heaven. If any one eats of this Bread, he will live for ever; and the Bread that I shall give is my flesh, which I will give for the Life of the world.&rdquo;</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.6.52"><span class="verse-num">52&nbsp;</span>Upon this the Jews began disputing with one another: &ldquo;How is it possible for this man to give us his flesh to eat?&rdquo;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.6.53"><span class="verse-num">53&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> &ldquo;In truth I tell you,&rdquo;</span>  answered Jesus, <span class="woc"> &ldquo;unless you eat the flesh of the Son of Man, and drink his blood, you have not Life within you.</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.6.54"><span class="verse-num">54&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> He who takes my flesh for his food, and drinks my blood, has Immortal Life; and I will raise him up at the Last Day.</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.6.55"><span class="verse-num">55&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> For my flesh is true food, and my blood true drink.</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.6.56"><span class="verse-num">56&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> He who takes my flesh for his food, and drinks my blood, remains united to me, and I to him.</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.6.57"><span class="verse-num">57&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> As the Living Father sent me as his Messenger, and as I live because the Father lives, so he who takes me for his food shall live because I live.</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.6.58"><span class="verse-num">58&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> That is the Bread which has come down from Heaven &mdash; not such as your ancestors ate, and yet died; he who takes this Bread for his food shall live for ever.&rdquo;</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.6.59"><span class="verse-num">59&nbsp;</span>All this Jesus said in a Synagogue, when he was teaching in Capernaum.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.6.60"><span class="verse-num">60&nbsp;</span>On hearing it, many of his disciples said: &ldquo;This is harsh doctrine! Who can bear to listen to it?&rdquo;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.6.61"><span class="verse-num">61&nbsp;</span>But Jesus, aware that his disciples were murmuring about it, said to them:</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.6.62"><span class="verse-num">62&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> &ldquo;Is this a hindrance to you? What, then, if you should see the Son of Man ascending where he was before?</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.6.63"><span class="verse-num">63&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> It is the Spirit that gives Life; mere flesh is of no avail. In the teaching that I have been giving you there is Spirit and there is Life.</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.6.64"><span class="verse-num">64&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> Yet there are some of you who do not believe in me.&rdquo;</span>  For Jesus knew from the first who they were that did not believe in him, and who it was that would betray him;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.6.65"><span class="verse-num">65&nbsp;</span>and he added: <span class="woc"> &ldquo;This is why I told you that no one can come to me, unless enabled by the Father.&rdquo;</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.6.66"><span class="verse-num">66&nbsp;</span>After this many of his disciples drew back, and did not go about with him any longer.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.6.67"><span class="verse-num">67&nbsp;</span>So Jesus said to the Twelve: <span class="woc"> &ldquo;Do you also wish to leave me?&rdquo;</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.6.68"><span class="verse-num">68&nbsp;</span>But Simon Peter answered: &ldquo;Master, to whom shall we go? Immortal Life is in your teaching;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.6.69"><span class="verse-num">69&nbsp;</span>and we have learned to believe and to know that you are the Holy One of God.&rdquo;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.6.70"><span class="verse-num">70&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> &ldquo;Did not I myself choose you to be the Twelve?&rdquo;</span>  replied Jesus; <span class="woc"> &ldquo;and yet, even of you, one is playing the &lsquo;Devil&rsquo;s&rsquo; part.&rdquo;</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.6.71"><span class="verse-num">71&nbsp;</span>He meant Judas, the son of Simon Iscariot, who was about to betray him, though he was one of the Twelve.</span>
