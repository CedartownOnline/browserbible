<h3>John’s Second Letter</h3>
<h2 class="chapter-num">1</h2>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="2John.1.1"><span class="verse-num verse-1">1&nbsp;</span>To an eminent Christian Lady, and to her Children, from the Officer of the Church. I sincerely love you all, and not I only, but also all those who have learned to know the Truth.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="2John.1.2"><span class="verse-num">2&nbsp;</span>We love you for the sake of that Truth which is always in our hearts; yes, and it will be ours for ever.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="2John.1.3"><span class="verse-num">3&nbsp;</span>Blessing, mercy, and peace will be ours &mdash; the gift of God, the Father, and of Jesus Christ, the Father&rsquo;s Son &mdash; in a life of truth and love.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="2John.1.4"><span class="verse-num">4&nbsp;</span>It was a great joy to me to find the lives of some of your children guided by the Truth, in obedience to the command that we received from the Father.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="2John.1.5"><span class="verse-num">5&nbsp;</span>And now, I pray you, Lady &mdash; not as though I were writing a new command for you; no, it is the command which we had from the first &mdash; Let us love one another.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="2John.1.6"><span class="verse-num">6&nbsp;</span>And this is love &mdash; to live in obedience to the Father&rsquo;s commands. This is the Command as you learned from the first, to live in a spirit of love.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="2John.1.7"><span class="verse-num">7&nbsp;</span>I say this because many impostors have left us to go into the world &mdash; men who do not acknowledge Jesus as Christ come in our human nature. It is that which marks a man as an impostor and an anti-Christ.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="2John.1.8"><span class="verse-num">8&nbsp;</span>Take care that you do not lose the fruit of all our work; rather, reap the benefit of it in full.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="2John.1.9"><span class="verse-num">9&nbsp;</span>Every one who goes beyond the limits of the Teaching of the Christ has failed to find God; the man who keeps to that Teaching &mdash; he has found both the Father and the Son.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="2John.1.10"><span class="verse-num">10&nbsp;</span>If any one comes to you and does not bring this Teaching, do not receive him into your house or welcome him;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="2John.1.11"><span class="verse-num">11&nbsp;</span>for the man who welcomes him is sharing with him in his wicked work.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="2John.1.12"><span class="verse-num">12&nbsp;</span>Though I have a great deal to say to you, I would rather not trust it to paper and ink, but I am hoping to come and see you, and to speak with you face to face, so that your joy may be complete.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="2John.1.13"><span class="verse-num">13&nbsp;</span>The children of your eminent sister send you their greetings.</span>
