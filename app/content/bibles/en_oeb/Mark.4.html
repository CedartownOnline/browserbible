<p>
<span class="verse Mark_4_1" data-osis="Mark.4.1"><span class="verse-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span>Jesus again began to teach by the Sea; and, as an immense crowd was gathering round him, he got into a boat, and sat in it on the Sea, while all the people were on the shore at the water&rsquo;s edge.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Mark_4_2" data-osis="Mark.4.2"><span class="verse-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span>Then he taught them many truths in parables; and in the course of his teaching he said to them:</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Mark_4_3" data-osis="Mark.4.3"><span class="verse-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> &ldquo;Listen! The sower went out to sow;</span></span>
<span class="verse Mark_4_4" data-osis="Mark.4.4"><span class="verse-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> and presently, as he was sowing, some of the seed fell along the path; and the birds came, and ate it up.</span></span>
<span class="verse Mark_4_5" data-osis="Mark.4.5"><span class="verse-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> Some fell on rocky ground, where it had not much soil, and, having no depth of soil, sprang up at once;</span></span>
<span class="verse Mark_4_6" data-osis="Mark.4.6"><span class="verse-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> but, when the sun rose, it was scorched, and, having no root, withered away.</span></span>
<span class="verse Mark_4_7" data-osis="Mark.4.7"><span class="verse-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> Some of the seed fell among brambles; but the brambles shot up and completely choked it, and it yielded no return.</span></span>
<span class="verse Mark_4_8" data-osis="Mark.4.8"><span class="verse-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> Some fell into good soil, and, shooting up and growing, yielded a return, amounting to thirty, sixty, and even a hundred fold.&rdquo;</span></span>
<span class="verse Mark_4_9" data-osis="Mark.4.9"><span class="verse-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span>And Jesus said: <span class="woc"> &ldquo;Let any one who has ears to hear with hear.&rdquo;</span></span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Mark_4_10" data-osis="Mark.4.10"><span class="verse-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span>Afterwards, when he was alone, his followers and the Twelve asked him about his parables;</span>
<span class="verse Mark_4_11" data-osis="Mark.4.11"><span class="verse-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span>and he said: <span class="woc"> &ldquo;To you the hidden truth of the Kingdom of God has been imparted; but to those who are outside it all teaching takes the form of parables, that &mdash; </span></span>
<span class="verse Mark_4_12" data-osis="Mark.4.12"><span class="verse-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> &lsquo;Though they have eyes, they may see without perceiving; and though they have ears, they may hear without understanding; lest some day they should turn and be forgiven.&rsquo;</span></span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Mark_4_13" data-osis="Mark.4.13"><span class="verse-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> &ldquo;You do not know the meaning of this parable!&rdquo;</span>  he went on; <span class="woc"> &ldquo;Then how will you understand all the other parables?</span></span>
<span class="verse Mark_4_14" data-osis="Mark.4.14"><span class="verse-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> The sower sows the Message.</span></span>
<span class="verse Mark_4_15" data-osis="Mark.4.15"><span class="verse-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> The People meant by the seed that falls along the path are these &mdash; where the Message is sown, but, as soon as they have heard it, Satan immediately comes and carries away the Message that has been sown in them.</span></span>
<span class="verse Mark_4_16" data-osis="Mark.4.16"><span class="verse-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> So, too, those meant by the seed sown on the rocky places are the people who, when they have heard the Message, at once accept it joyfully;</span></span>
<span class="verse Mark_4_17" data-osis="Mark.4.17"><span class="verse-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> but, as they have no root, they stand only for a short time; and so, when trouble or persecution arises on account of the Message, they fall away at once.</span></span>
<span class="verse Mark_4_18" data-osis="Mark.4.18"><span class="verse-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> Those meant by the seed sown among the brambles are different; they are the people who hear the Message,</span></span>
<span class="verse Mark_4_19" data-osis="Mark.4.19"><span class="verse-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> but the cares of life, and the glamour of wealth, and cravings for many other things come in and completely choke the Message, so that it gives no return.</span></span>
<span class="verse Mark_4_20" data-osis="Mark.4.20"><span class="verse-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> But the people meant by the seed sown on the good ground are those who hear the Message, and welcome it, and yield a return, thirty, sixty, and even a hundred fold.&rdquo;</span></span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Mark_4_21" data-osis="Mark.4.21"><span class="verse-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span>And Jesus said to them: <span class="woc"> &ldquo;Is a lamp brought to be put under the corn-measure or under the couch, instead of being put on the lampstand?</span></span>
<span class="verse Mark_4_22" data-osis="Mark.4.22"><span class="verse-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> Nothing is hidden unless it is some day to come to light, nor was anything ever kept hidden but that it should some day come into the light of day.</span></span>
<span class="verse Mark_4_23" data-osis="Mark.4.23"><span class="verse-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> Let all who have ears to hear with hear.</span></span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Mark_4_24" data-osis="Mark.4.24"><span class="verse-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> Take care what you listen to,&rdquo;</span>  said Jesus. <span class="woc"> &ldquo;The measure you mete will be meted out to you, and more will be added for you.</span></span>
<span class="verse Mark_4_25" data-osis="Mark.4.25"><span class="verse-num v-25">25&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> For, to those who have, more will be given; while, from those who have nothing, even what they have will be taken away.&rdquo;</span></span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Mark_4_26" data-osis="Mark.4.26"><span class="verse-num v-26">26&nbsp;</span>Jesus also said: <span class="woc"> &ldquo;This is what the Kingdom of God is like &mdash; like a man who has scattered seed on the ground,</span></span>
<span class="verse Mark_4_27" data-osis="Mark.4.27"><span class="verse-num v-27">27&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> and then sleeps by night and rises by day, while the seed is shooting up and growing &mdash; he knows not how.</span></span>
<span class="verse Mark_4_28" data-osis="Mark.4.28"><span class="verse-num v-28">28&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> The ground bears the crop of itself &mdash; first the blade, then the ear, and then the full grain in the ear;</span></span>
<span class="verse Mark_4_29" data-osis="Mark.4.29"><span class="verse-num v-29">29&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> but, as soon as the crop is ready, immediately he &lsquo;puts in the sickle because harvest has come&rsquo;.&rdquo;</span></span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Mark_4_30" data-osis="Mark.4.30"><span class="verse-num v-30">30&nbsp;</span>Jesus also said: <span class="woc"> &ldquo;To what can we liken the Kingdom of God?</span></span>
<span class="verse Mark_4_31" data-osis="Mark.4.31"><span class="verse-num v-31">31&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> By what can we illustrate it? Perhaps by the growth of a mustard-seed. This seed, when sown in the ground, though it is smaller than all other seeds,</span></span>
<span class="verse Mark_4_32" data-osis="Mark.4.32"><span class="verse-num v-32">32&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> yet, when sown, shoots up, and becomes larger than any other herb, and puts out great branches, so that even &lsquo;the wild birds can roost in its shelter.&rsquo;&rdquo;</span></span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Mark_4_33" data-osis="Mark.4.33"><span class="verse-num v-33">33&nbsp;</span>With many such parables Jesus used to speak to the people of his Message, as far as they were able to receive it;</span>
<span class="verse Mark_4_34" data-osis="Mark.4.34"><span class="verse-num v-34">34&nbsp;</span>and to them he never used to speak except in parables; but in private to his own disciples he explained everything.</span>
<span class="verse Mark_4_35" data-osis="Mark.4.35"><span class="verse-num v-35">35&nbsp;</span>In the evening of the same day, Jesus said to them: <span class="woc"> &ldquo;Let us go across.&rdquo;</span></span>
<span class="verse Mark_4_36" data-osis="Mark.4.36"><span class="verse-num v-36">36&nbsp;</span>So, leaving the crowd behind, they took him with them, just as he was, in the boat; and there were other boats with him.</span>
<span class="verse Mark_4_37" data-osis="Mark.4.37"><span class="verse-num v-37">37&nbsp;</span>A violent squall came on, and the waves kept dashing into the boat, so that the boat was actually filling.</span>
<span class="verse Mark_4_38" data-osis="Mark.4.38"><span class="verse-num v-38">38&nbsp;</span>Jesus was in the stern asleep upon the cushion; and the disciples roused him and cried: &ldquo;Teacher! is it nothing to you that we are lost?&rdquo;</span>
<span class="verse Mark_4_39" data-osis="Mark.4.39"><span class="verse-num v-39">39&nbsp;</span>Jesus rose and rebuked the wind, and said to the sea: <span class="woc"> &ldquo;Hush! Be still!&rdquo;</span>  Then the wind dropped, and a great calm followed.</span>
<span class="verse Mark_4_40" data-osis="Mark.4.40"><span class="verse-num v-40">40&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> &ldquo;Why are you so timid?&rdquo;</span>  he exclaimed. <span class="woc"> &ldquo;Have you no faith yet?&rdquo;</span></span>
<span class="verse Mark_4_41" data-osis="Mark.4.41"><span class="verse-num v-41">41&nbsp;</span>But they were struck with great awe, and said to one another: &rdquo;Who can this be that even the wind and the sea obey him?&rdquo;</span>
