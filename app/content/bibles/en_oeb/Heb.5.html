<span class="verse" data-osis="Heb.5.1"><span class="verse-num verse-1">1&nbsp;</span>Every High Priest, taken from among men, is appointed as a representative of his fellow-men in their relations with God, to offer both gifts and sacrifices in expiation of sins.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Heb.5.2"><span class="verse-num">2&nbsp;</span>And he is able to sympathise with the ignorant and deluded, since he is himself subject to weakness,</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Heb.5.3"><span class="verse-num">3&nbsp;</span>and is therefore bound to offer sacrifices for sins, not only for the People, but equally so for himself.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Heb.5.4"><span class="verse-num">4&nbsp;</span>Nor does any one take that high office upon himself, till he has been called to do so by God, as Aaron was.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Heb.5.5"><span class="verse-num">5&nbsp;</span>In the same way, even the Christ did not take the honour of the High Priesthood upon himself, but he was appointed by him who said to him &mdash;  &lsquo;Thou art my Son; this day I have become thy Father&rsquo;;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Heb.5.6"><span class="verse-num">6&nbsp;</span>and on another occasion also &mdash;  &lsquo;Thou art a priest for all time of the order of Melchizedek.&rsquo;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Heb.5.7"><span class="verse-num">7&nbsp;</span>Jesus, in the days of his earthly life, offered prayers and supplications, with earnest cries and with tears, to him who was able to save him from death; and he was heard because of his devout submission.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Heb.5.8"><span class="verse-num">8&nbsp;</span>Son though he was, he learned obedience from his sufferings;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Heb.5.9"><span class="verse-num">9&nbsp;</span>and, being made perfect, he became to all those who obey him the source of eternal Salvation,</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Heb.5.10"><span class="verse-num">10&nbsp;</span>while God himself pronounced him a High Priest of the order of Melchizedek.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Heb.5.11"><span class="verse-num">11&nbsp;</span>Now on this subject I have much to say, but it is difficult to explain it to you, because you have shown yourselves so slow to learn.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Heb.5.12"><span class="verse-num">12&nbsp;</span>For whereas, considering the time that has elapsed, you ought to be teaching others, you still need some one to teach you the very alphabet of the Divine Revelation, and need again to be fed with &lsquo;milk&rsquo; instead of with &lsquo;solid food.&rsquo;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Heb.5.13"><span class="verse-num">13&nbsp;</span>For every one who still has to take &lsquo;milk&rsquo; knows nothing of the Teaching of Righteousness; he is a mere infant.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Heb.5.14"><span class="verse-num">14&nbsp;</span>But &lsquo;solid food&rsquo; is for Christians of mature faith &mdash; those whose faculties have been trained by practice to distinguish right from wrong.</span>
