<span class="verse" data-osis="Rev.3.2"><span class="verse-num">2&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> Be on the watch, and strengthen what still survives, though once it was all but dead; for I have not found your life perfect in the eyes of my God.</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Rev.3.3"><span class="verse-num">3&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> Therefore remember what you have received and heard, and lay it to heart and repent.

<span class="verse" data-osis="Rev.3.4"><span class="verse-num">4&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> Yet there are some few among you at Sardis who did not soil their robes; they shall walk with me, robed in white, for they are worthy.</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Rev.3.5"><span class="verse-num">5&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> He who conquers shall be clothed in these white robes, and I will not &lsquo;strike his name out of the Book of Life&rsquo;; but I will own him before my Father, and before his angels.</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Rev.3.8"><span class="verse-num">8&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> I know your life (see, I have set a door open before you which no one is able to shut), I know that, though you have but little strength, you kept my teaching in mind, and did not disown my Name.</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Rev.3.9"><span class="verse-num">9&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> Listen, I give some of the Congregation of Satan, the men who declare that they are Jews, though they are not, but are lying &mdash;  &mdash; I will make them &lsquo;come and bow down at your feet,&rsquo; and they shall learn that I loved you.</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Rev.3.10"><span class="verse-num">10&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> Because you kept in mind the story of my endurance, I will keep you in the hour of trial that is about to come upon the whole world, the hour that will test all who are living upon earth.</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Rev.3.19"><span class="verse-num">19&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> &lsquo;All whom I love I rebuke and discipline.&rsquo; Therefore be in earnest and repent.</span></span>
