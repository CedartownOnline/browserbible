<span class="verse" data-osis="John.19.1"><span class="verse-num verse-1">1&nbsp;</span>After that, Pilate had Jesus scourged.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.19.2"><span class="verse-num">2&nbsp;</span>The soldiers made a crown with some thorns and put it on his head and threw a purple robe round him.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.19.3"><span class="verse-num">3&nbsp;</span>They kept coming up to him and saying: &ldquo;Long live the King of the Jews!&rdquo; and they gave him blow after blow with their hands.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.19.4"><span class="verse-num">4&nbsp;</span>Pilate again came outside, and said to the people: &ldquo;Look! I am bringing him out to you, so that you may know that I find nothing with which he can be charged.&rdquo;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.19.5"><span class="verse-num">5&nbsp;</span>Then Jesus came outside, wearing the crown of thorns and the purple robe; and Pilate said to them: &ldquo;Here is the man!&rdquo;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.19.6"><span class="verse-num">6&nbsp;</span>When the Chief Priests and the police-officers saw him, they shouted: &ldquo;Crucify him! Crucify him!&rdquo; &ldquo;Take him yourselves and crucify him,&rdquo; said Pilate. &ldquo;For my part, I find nothing with which he can be charged.&rdquo;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.19.7"><span class="verse-num">7&nbsp;</span>&ldquo;But we,&rdquo; replied the Jews, &ldquo;have a Law, under which he deserves death for making himself out to be the Son of God.&rdquo;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.19.8"><span class="verse-num">8&nbsp;</span>When Pilate heard what they said, he became still more alarmed;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.19.9"><span class="verse-num">9&nbsp;</span>and, going into the Government House again, he said to Jesus: &ldquo;Where do you come from?&rdquo;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.19.10"><span class="verse-num">10&nbsp;</span>But Jesus made no reply. So Pilate said to him: &ldquo;Do you refuse to speak to me? Do not you know that I have power to release you, and have power to crucify you?&rdquo;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.19.11"><span class="verse-num">11&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> &ldquo;You would have no power over me at all,&rdquo;</span>  answered Jesus, <span class="woc"> &ldquo;if it had not been given you from above; and, therefore, the man who betrayed me to you is guilty of the greater sin.&rdquo;</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.19.12"><span class="verse-num">12&nbsp;</span>This made Pilate anxious to release him; but the Jews shouted: &ldquo;If you release that man, you are no friend of the Emperor! Any one who makes himself out to be a King is setting himself against the Emperor!&rdquo;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.19.13"><span class="verse-num">13&nbsp;</span>On hearing what they said, Pilate brought Jesus out, and took his seat upon the Bench at a place called &lsquo;The Stone Pavement&rsquo; &mdash; in Hebrew &lsquo;Gabbatha.&rsquo;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.19.14"><span class="verse-num">14&nbsp;</span>It was the Passover Preparation Day, and about noon. Then he said to the Jews: &ldquo;Here is your King!&rdquo;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.19.15"><span class="verse-num">15&nbsp;</span>At that the people shouted: &ldquo;Kill him! Kill him! Crucify him!&rdquo; &ldquo;What! shall I crucify your King?&rdquo; exclaimed Pilate. &ldquo;We have no King but the Emperor,&rdquo; replied the Chief Priests;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.19.16"><span class="verse-num">16&nbsp;</span>whereupon Pilate gave Jesus up to them to be crucified. So they took Jesus;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.19.17"><span class="verse-num">17&nbsp;</span>and he went out, carrying his cross himself, to the place which is named from a scull, or, in Hebrew, Golgotha.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.19.18"><span class="verse-num">18&nbsp;</span>There they crucified him, and two others with him &mdash; one on each side, and Jesus between them.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.19.19"><span class="verse-num">19&nbsp;</span>Pilate also had these words written and put up over the cross &mdash; &lsquo;JESUS OF NAZARETH, THE KING OF THE JEWS.&rsquo;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.19.20"><span class="verse-num">20&nbsp;</span>These words were read by many of the Jews, because the place where Jesus was crucified was near the city; and they were written in Hebrew, Latin and Greek.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.19.21"><span class="verse-num">21&nbsp;</span>The Jewish Chief Priests said to Pilate: &ldquo;Do not write &lsquo;The King of the Jews&rsquo;, but write what the man said &mdash; &lsquo;I am the King of the Jews.&rsquo;&rdquo;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.19.22"><span class="verse-num">22&nbsp;</span>But Pilate answered: &ldquo;What I have written, I have written.&rdquo;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.19.23"><span class="verse-num">23&nbsp;</span>When the soldiers had crucified Jesus, they took his clothes and divided them into four shares &mdash; a share for each soldier &mdash; and they took the coat also. The coat had no seam, being woven in one piece from top to bottom.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.19.24"><span class="verse-num">24&nbsp;</span>So they said to one another: &ldquo;Do not let us tear it, but let us cast lots for it, to see who shall have it.&rdquo; This was in fulfilment of the words of Scripture &mdash; &lsquo;They shared my clothes among them, And over my clothing they cast lots.&rsquo; That was what the soldiers did.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.19.25"><span class="verse-num">25&nbsp;</span>Meanwhile near the cross of Jesus were standing his mother and his mother&rsquo;s sister, as well as Mary the wife of Clopas and Mary of Magdala.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.19.26"><span class="verse-num">26&nbsp;</span>When Jesus saw his mother, and the disciple whom he loved, standing near, he said to his mother: <span class="woc"> &ldquo;There is your son.&rdquo;</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.19.27"><span class="verse-num">27&nbsp;</span>Then he said to that disciple: <span class="woc"> &ldquo;There is your mother.&rdquo;</span>  And from that very hour the disciple took her to live in his house.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.19.28"><span class="verse-num">28&nbsp;</span>Afterwards, knowing that everything was now finished, Jesus said, in fulfilment of the words of Scripture: <span class="woc"> &ldquo;I am thirsty.&rdquo;</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.19.29"><span class="verse-num">29&nbsp;</span>There was a bowl standing there full of common wine; so they put a sponge soaked in the wine on the end of a hyssop-stalk, and held it up to his mouth.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.19.30"><span class="verse-num">30&nbsp;</span>When Jesus had received the wine, he exclaimed: <span class="woc"> &ldquo;All is finished!&rdquo;</span>  Then, bowing his head, he resigned his spirit to God.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.19.31"><span class="verse-num">31&nbsp;</span>It was the Preparation Day, and so, to prevent the bodies from remaining on the crosses during the Sabbath (for that Sabbath was a great day), the Jews asked Pilate to have the legs broken and the bodies removed.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.19.32"><span class="verse-num">32&nbsp;</span>Accordingly the soldiers came and broke the legs of the first man, and then those of the other who had been crucified with Jesus;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.19.33"><span class="verse-num">33&nbsp;</span>but, on coming to him, when they saw that he was already dead, they did not break his legs.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.19.34"><span class="verse-num">34&nbsp;</span>One of the soldiers, however, pierced his side with a spear, and blood and water immediately flowed from it.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.19.35"><span class="verse-num">35&nbsp;</span>This is the statement of one who actually saw it &mdash; and his statement may be relied upon, and he knows that he is speaking the truth &mdash; and it is given in order that you also may be convinced.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.19.36"><span class="verse-num">36&nbsp;</span>For all this took place in fulfilment of the words of Scripture &mdash; &lsquo;Not one of its bones shall be broken.&rsquo;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.19.37"><span class="verse-num">37&nbsp;</span>And there is another passage which says &mdash; &lsquo;They will look upon him whom they pierced.&rsquo;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.19.38"><span class="verse-num">38&nbsp;</span>After this, Joseph of Ramah, a disciple of Jesus &mdash; but a secret one, owing to his fear of the Jews &mdash; begged Pilate&rsquo;s permission to remove the body of Jesus. Pilate gave him leave; so Joseph went and removed the body.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.19.39"><span class="verse-num">39&nbsp;</span>Nicodemus, too &mdash; the man who had formerly visited Jesus by night &mdash; came with a roll of myrrh and aloes, weighing nearly a hundred pounds.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.19.40"><span class="verse-num">40&nbsp;</span>They took the body of Jesus, and wound it in linen with the spices, according to the Jewish mode of burial.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.19.41"><span class="verse-num">41&nbsp;</span>At the place where Jesus had been crucified there was a garden, and in the garden a newly-made tomb in which no one had ever been laid.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.19.42"><span class="verse-num">42&nbsp;</span>And so, because of its being the Preparation Day, and as the tomb was close at hand, they laid Jesus there.</span>
