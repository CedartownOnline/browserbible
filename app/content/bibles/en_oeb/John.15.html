<span class="verse" data-osis="John.15.1"><span class="verse-num verse-1">1&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> I am the True Vine, and my Father is the Vine-grower.</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.15.2"><span class="verse-num">2&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> Any unfruitful branch in me he takes away, and he cleanses every fruitful branch, that it may bear more fruit.</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.15.3"><span class="verse-num">3&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> You are already clean because of the Message that I have given you.</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.15.4"><span class="verse-num">4&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> Remain united to me, and I will remain united to you. As a branch cannot bear fruit by itself, unless it remains united to the vine; no more can you, unless you remain united to me.</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.15.5"><span class="verse-num">5&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> I am the Vine, you are the branches. He that remains united to me, while I remain united to him &mdash; he bears fruit plentifully; for you can do nothing apart from me.</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.15.6"><span class="verse-num">6&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> If any one does not remain united to me, he is thrown away, as a branch would be, and withers up. Such branches are collected and thrown into the fire, and are burnt.</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.15.7"><span class="verse-num">7&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> If you remain united to me, and my teaching remains in your hearts, ask whatever you wish, and it shall be yours.</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.15.8"><span class="verse-num">8&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> It is by your bearing fruit plentifully, and so showing yourselves my disciples, that my Father is honoured.</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.15.9"><span class="verse-num">9&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> As the Father has loved me, so have I loved you; remain in my love.</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.15.10"><span class="verse-num">10&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> If you lay my commands to heart, you will remain in my love; just as I have laid the Father&rsquo;s commands to heart and remain in his love.</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.15.11"><span class="verse-num">11&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> I have told you all this so that my own joy may be yours, and that your joy may be complete.</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.15.12"><span class="verse-num">12&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> This is my command &mdash; Love one another, as I have loved you.</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.15.13"><span class="verse-num">13&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> No one can give greater proof of love than by laying down his life for his friends.</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.15.14"><span class="verse-num">14&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> And you are my friends, if you do what I command you.</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.15.15"><span class="verse-num">15&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> I no longer call you &lsquo;servants,&rsquo; because a servant does not know what his master is doing; but I have given you the name of &lsquo;friends,&rsquo; because I made known to you everything that I learned from my Father.</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.15.16"><span class="verse-num">16&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> It was not you who chose me, but I who chose you, and I appointed you to go and bear fruit &mdash; fruit that should remain, so that the Father might grant you whatever you ask in my Name.</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.15.17"><span class="verse-num">17&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> I am giving you these commands that you may love one another.</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.15.18"><span class="verse-num">18&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> If the world hates you, you know that it has first hated me.</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.15.19"><span class="verse-num">19&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> If you belonged to the world, the world would love its own. Because you do not belong to the world, but I have chosen you out of the world &mdash; that is why the world hates you.</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.15.20"><span class="verse-num">20&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> Remember what I said to you &mdash; &lsquo;A servant is not greater than his master.&rsquo; If they have persecuted me, they will also persecute you; if they have laid my Message to heart, they will lay yours to heart also.</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.15.21"><span class="verse-num">21&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> But they will do all this to you, because you believe in my Name, for they do not know him who sent me.</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.15.22"><span class="verse-num">22&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> If I had not come and spoken to them, they would have had no sin to answer for; but as it is, they have no excuse for their sin.</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.15.23"><span class="verse-num">23&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> He who hates me hates my Father also.</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.15.24"><span class="verse-num">24&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> If I had not done among them such work as no one else ever did, they would have had no sin to answer for; but, as it is, they have both seen and hated both me and my Father.</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.15.25"><span class="verse-num">25&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> And so is fulfilled what is said in their Law &mdash; &lsquo;They hated me without cause.&rsquo;</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.15.26"><span class="verse-num">26&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> But, when the Helper comes, whom I will send to you from the Father &mdash; the Spirit of Truth, who comes from the Father &mdash; he will bear testimony to me;</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.15.27"><span class="verse-num">27&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> yes, and you also are to bear testimony, because you have been with me from the first.</span></span>
