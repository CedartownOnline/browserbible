<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.28.1"><span class="verse-num verse-1">1&nbsp;</span>After the Sabbath, as the first day of the week began to dawn, Mary of Magdala and the other Mary had gone to look at the grave,</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.28.2"><span class="verse-num">2&nbsp;</span>when suddenly a great earthquake occurred. For an angel of the Lord descended from Heaven, and came and rolled away the stone, and seated himself upon it.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.28.3"><span class="verse-num">3&nbsp;</span>His appearance was as dazzling as lightning, and his clothing was as white as snow;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.28.4"><span class="verse-num">4&nbsp;</span>and, in their terror of him, the men on guard trembled violently and became like dead men.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.28.5"><span class="verse-num">5&nbsp;</span>But the angel, addressing the women, said; &ldquo;You need not be afraid. I now that it is Jesus, who was crucified, for whom you are looking.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.28.6"><span class="verse-num">6&nbsp;</span>He is not here; for he has risen, as he said he would. Come, and see the place where he was lying;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.28.7"><span class="verse-num">7&nbsp;</span>and then go quickly and say to him disciples &lsquo;He has risen from the dead, and is going before you into Galilee; there you will see him.&rsquo; Remember, I have told you.&rdquo;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.28.8"><span class="verse-num">8&nbsp;</span>On this they left the tomb quickly, in awe and great joy, and ran to tell the news to the disciples.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.28.9"><span class="verse-num">9&nbsp;</span>Suddenly Jesus met them. <span class="woc"> &ldquo;Welcome!&rdquo; </span>  he said. The women went up to him, and clasped his feet, bowing to the ground before him. Then Jesus said to them:</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.28.10"><span class="verse-num">10&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> &ldquo;Do not be afraid; go and tell my brothers to set out for Galilee, and they shall see me there.&rdquo; </span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.28.11"><span class="verse-num">11&nbsp;</span>While they were still on their way, some of the guard came into the city, and reported to the Chief Priests everything that had happened.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.28.12"><span class="verse-num">12&nbsp;</span>So they and the Councillors met and, after holding a consultation, gave a large sum of money to the soldiers,</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.28.13"><span class="verse-num">13&nbsp;</span>and told them to say that his disciples came in the night, and stole him while they were asleep;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.28.14"><span class="verse-num">14&nbsp;</span>&ldquo;And should this matter come before the Governor,&rdquo; they added, &ldquo;we will satisfy him, and see that you have nothing to fear.&rdquo;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.28.15"><span class="verse-num">15&nbsp;</span>So the soldiers took the money, and did as they were instructed. And this story has been current among the Jews from that day to this.</span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.28.16"><span class="verse-num">16&nbsp;</span>The eleven disciples went to Galilee, to the mountain where Jesus told them to meet him;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.28.17"><span class="verse-num">17&nbsp;</span>and, when they saw him, they bowed to the ground before him; although some felt doubtful.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.28.18"><span class="verse-num">18&nbsp;</span>Then Jesus came up, and spoke to them thus:</span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.28.19"><span class="verse-num">19&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> Therefore go and make disciples of all the nations, baptizing them into the Faith of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit,</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.28.20"><span class="verse-num">20&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> and teaching them to lay to heart all the commands that I have given you; and, remember, I myself am with you every day until the close of the age.&rdquo; </span></span>
