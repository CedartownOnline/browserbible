<span class="verse" data-osis="Rev.6.1"><span class="verse-num verse-1">1&nbsp;</span>Then I saw the Lamb break one of the seven seals, and I heard one of the four Creatures crying with a voice like thunder &mdash; &lsquo;Come.&rsquo;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Rev.6.2"><span class="verse-num">2&nbsp;</span>And in my vision I saw &lsquo;a white horse.&rsquo; Its rider held a bow, and he was given a crown, and he went out conquering and to conquer.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Rev.6.3"><span class="verse-num">3&nbsp;</span>When the Lamb broke the second seal, I heard the second Creature crying &mdash; &lsquo;Come.&rsquo;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Rev.6.4"><span class="verse-num">4&nbsp;</span>Then there went out another horse, &lsquo;a red horse,&rsquo; and to its rider was given the power to deprive the earth of peace, so that men should kill one another; and he was given a great sword.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Rev.6.5"><span class="verse-num">5&nbsp;</span>When the Lamb broke the third seal, I heard the third Creature crying &mdash; &lsquo;Come.&rsquo; And in my vision I saw &lsquo;a black horse.&rsquo; Its rider held scales in his hand.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Rev.6.6"><span class="verse-num">6&nbsp;</span>And I heard what seemed to be a voice, coming from among the four Creatures, crying &mdash; &lsquo;A quart of wheat for a florin, and three quarts of barley for a florin! But do not harm the oil and the wine.&rsquo;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Rev.6.7"><span class="verse-num">7&nbsp;</span>When the Lamb broke the fourth seal, I heard the voice of the fourth Creature crying &mdash;  &lsquo;Come.&rsquo;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Rev.6.8"><span class="verse-num">8&nbsp;</span>And in my vision I saw a grey horse. His rider&rsquo;s name was Death, and the Lord of the Place of Death rode behind him; and power was given them over the fourth part of the earth, so that they might &lsquo;destroy with sword and famine and death, and by means of the wild beasts of the earth.&rsquo;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Rev.6.9"><span class="verse-num">9&nbsp;</span>When the Lamb opened the fifth seal, I saw under the altar the souls of those who had been killed for the sake of God&rsquo;s Message and for the testimony which they had borne.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Rev.6.10"><span class="verse-num">10&nbsp;</span>They cried in a loud voice &mdash; &lsquo;How long, O Sovereign Lord, holy and true, before thou wilt give judgment and avenge our blood upon all who are living upon the earth?&rsquo;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Rev.6.11"><span class="verse-num">11&nbsp;</span>Then to each of them was given a white robe, and they were told to rest yet a little longer, till the number of their fellow-servants and of their Brothers who were about to be put to death, as they had been, should be complete.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Rev.6.12"><span class="verse-num">12&nbsp;</span>And I saw the Lamb break the sixth seal, and then there was a great earthquake. The sun became black, like sackcloth, and the moon, which was at its full, like blood.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Rev.6.13"><span class="verse-num">13&nbsp;</span>&lsquo;The stars of the heavens fell&rsquo; to the earth, as when a fig-tree, shaken by a strong wind, drops its unripe fruit.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Rev.6.14"><span class="verse-num">14&nbsp;</span>The heavens disappeared like a scroll when it is rolled up, and every mountain and island was moved from its place.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Rev.6.15"><span class="verse-num">15&nbsp;</span>Then all the kings of the earth, and the princes, and the generals, and the rich, and the powerful, and every slave and free man, &lsquo;hid themselves in the caves and under the rocks&rsquo; of the mountains;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Rev.6.16"><span class="verse-num">16&nbsp;</span>and they are crying to the mountains and the rocks &mdash;  &lsquo;Fall upon us, and hide us from the eyes of him who is seated on the throne, and from the Wrath of the Lamb,</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Rev.6.17"><span class="verse-num">17&nbsp;</span>for the great Day of their Wrath is come, and who can stand to meet it?&rsquo;</span>
