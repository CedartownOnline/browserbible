<span class="verse" data-osis="John.21.1"><span class="verse-num verse-1">1&nbsp;</span>Later on, Jesus showed himself again to the disciples by the Sea of Tiberias.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.21.2"><span class="verse-num">2&nbsp;</span>It was in this way: &mdash; Simon Peter, Thomas, who was called &lsquo;The Twin,&rsquo; Nathanael of Cana in Galilee, Zebediah&rsquo;s sons, and two other disciples of Jesus, were together, when Simon Peter said:</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.21.3"><span class="verse-num">3&nbsp;</span>&ldquo;I am going fishing.&rdquo; &ldquo;We will come with you,&rdquo; said the others. They went out and got into the boat, but caught nothing that night.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.21.4"><span class="verse-num">4&nbsp;</span>Just as day was breaking, Jesus came and stood on the beach; but the disciples did not know that it was he.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.21.5"><span class="verse-num">5&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> &ldquo;My children,&rdquo;</span>  he said, <span class="woc"> &ldquo;have you anything to eat?&rdquo;</span>  &ldquo;No,&rdquo; they answered.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.21.6"><span class="verse-num">6&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> &ldquo;Cast your net to the right of the boat,&rdquo;</span>  he said, <span class="woc"> &ldquo;and you will find fish.&rdquo;</span>  So they cast the net, and now they could not haul it in on account of the quantity of fish.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.21.7"><span class="verse-num">7&nbsp;</span>Upon this the disciple whom Jesus loved said to Peter: &ldquo;It is the Master!&rdquo; When Simon Peter heard that it was the Master, he fastened his coat round him (for he had taken it off), and threw himself into the Sea.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.21.8"><span class="verse-num">8&nbsp;</span>But the rest of the disciples came in the boat (for they were only about a hundred yards from shore), dragging the net full of fish.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.21.9"><span class="verse-num">9&nbsp;</span>When they had come ashore, they found a charcoal fire ready, with some fish already on it, and some bread as well.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.21.10"><span class="verse-num">10&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> &ldquo;Bring some of the fish which you have just caught,&rdquo;</span>  said Jesus.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.21.11"><span class="verse-num">11&nbsp;</span>So Simon Peter got into the boat and hauled the net ashore full of large fish, a hundred and fifty-three of them; and yet, although there were so many, the net had not been torn.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.21.12"><span class="verse-num">12&nbsp;</span>And Jesus said to them: <span class="woc"> &ldquo;Come and breakfast.&rdquo;</span>  Not one of the disciples ventured to ask him who he was, knowing that it was the Master.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.21.13"><span class="verse-num">13&nbsp;</span>Jesus went and took the bread and gave it to them, and the fish too.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.21.14"><span class="verse-num">14&nbsp;</span>This was the third time that Jesus showed himself to the disciples after he had risen from the dead.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.21.15"><span class="verse-num">15&nbsp;</span>When breakfast was over, Jesus said to Simon Peter: <span class="woc"> &ldquo;Simon, son of John, do you love me more than the others?&rdquo;</span>  &ldquo;Yes, Master,&rdquo; he answered, &ldquo;you know that I am your friend.&rdquo; <span class="woc"> &ldquo;Feed my lambs,&rdquo;</span>  said Jesus.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.21.16"><span class="verse-num">16&nbsp;</span>Then, a second time, Jesus asked: <span class="woc"> &ldquo;Simon, son of John, do you love me?&rdquo;</span>  &ldquo;Yes, Master,&rdquo; he answered, &ldquo;you know that I am your friend.&rdquo; <span class="woc"> &ldquo;Tend my sheep,&rdquo;</span>  said Jesus.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.21.17"><span class="verse-num">17&nbsp;</span>The third time, Jesus said to him: <span class="woc"> &ldquo;Simon, son of John, are you my friend?&rdquo;</span>  Peter was hurt at his third question being &lsquo;Are you my friend?&rsquo;; and exclaimed: &ldquo;Master, you know everything! You can tell that I am your friend.&rdquo; <span class="woc"> &ldquo;Feed my sheep,&rdquo;</span>  said Jesus.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.21.18"><span class="verse-num">18&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> &ldquo;In truth I tell you,&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;when you were young, you used to put on your own girdle, and walk wherever you wished; but, when you have grown old, you will have to stretch out your hands, while some one else puts on your girdle, and takes you where you do not wish.&rdquo;</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.21.19"><span class="verse-num">19&nbsp;</span>Jesus said this to show the death by which Peter was to honour God, and then he added: <span class="woc"> &ldquo;Follow me.&rdquo;</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.21.20"><span class="verse-num">20&nbsp;</span>Peter turned round, and saw the disciple whom Jesus loved following &mdash; the one who at the supper leant back on the Master&rsquo;s shoulder, and asked him who it was that would betray him.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.21.21"><span class="verse-num">21&nbsp;</span>Seeing him, Peter said to Jesus: &ldquo;Master, what about this man?&rdquo;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.21.22"><span class="verse-num">22&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> &ldquo;If it is my will that he should wait till I come,&rdquo;</span>  answered Jesus, <span class="woc"> &ldquo;what has that to do with you? Follow me yourself.&rdquo;</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.21.23"><span class="verse-num">23&nbsp;</span>So the report spread among the Brethren that that disciple was not to die; yet Jesus did not say that he was not to die, but said <span class="woc"> &ldquo;If it is my will that he should wait till I come, what has that to do with you?&rdquo;</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.21.24"><span class="verse-num">24&nbsp;</span>It is this disciple who states these things, and who recorded them; and we know that his statement is true.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.21.25"><span class="verse-num">25&nbsp;</span>There are many other things which Jesus did; but, if every one of them were to be recorded in detail, I suppose that even the world itself would not hold the books that would be written.</span>
