<span class="verse" data-osis="1Cor.16.1"><span class="verse-num verse-1">1&nbsp;</span>With reference to the Collection for Christ&rsquo;s People, I want you to follow the instructions that I gave to the Churches in Galatia.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="1Cor.16.2"><span class="verse-num">2&nbsp;</span>On the first day of every week each of you should put by what he can afford, so that no collections need be made after I have come.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="1Cor.16.3"><span class="verse-num">3&nbsp;</span>On my arrival, I will send any persons, whom you may authorise by letter, to carry your gift to Jerusalem;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="1Cor.16.4"><span class="verse-num">4&nbsp;</span>and, if it appears to be worth while for me to go also, they shall go with me.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="1Cor.16.5"><span class="verse-num">5&nbsp;</span>I will come to you as soon as I have been through Macedonia- -for I am going through Macedonia-</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="1Cor.16.6"><span class="verse-num">6&nbsp;</span>And I shall probably make some stay with you or, perhaps, remain for the winter, so that you may yourselves send me on my way, wherever I may be going.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="1Cor.16.7"><span class="verse-num">7&nbsp;</span>I do not propose to pay you a visit in passing now, for I hope to stay with you for some time, if the Lord permits.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="1Cor.16.8"><span class="verse-num">8&nbsp;</span>I intend, however, staying at Ephesus till the Festival at the close of the Harvest;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="1Cor.16.9"><span class="verse-num">9&nbsp;</span>for a great opening for active work has presented itself, and there are many opponents.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="1Cor.16.10"><span class="verse-num">10&nbsp;</span>If Timothy comes, take care that he has no cause for feeling anxious while he is with you. He is doing the Master&rsquo;s work no less than I am.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="1Cor.16.11"><span class="verse-num">11&nbsp;</span>No one, therefore, should slight him. See him safely on his way to me, for I am expecting him with some of our Brothers.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="1Cor.16.12"><span class="verse-num">12&nbsp;</span>As for our Brother Apollos, I have often urged him to go to you with the others. He has, however, been very unwilling to do so as yet; but he will go as soon as he finds a good opportunity.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="1Cor.16.13"><span class="verse-num">13&nbsp;</span>Be watchful; stand firm in your faith; show yourselves men; be strong.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="1Cor.16.14"><span class="verse-num">14&nbsp;</span>Let everything you do be done in a loving spirit.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="1Cor.16.15"><span class="verse-num">15&nbsp;</span>I have another request to make of you, Brothers. You remember Stephanas and his household, and that they were the first-fruits gathered in from Greece, and set themselves to serve Christ&rsquo;s People.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="1Cor.16.16"><span class="verse-num">16&nbsp;</span>I want you, on your part, to show deference to such men as these, as well as to every fellow labourer and earnest worker.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="1Cor.16.17"><span class="verse-num">17&nbsp;</span>I am glad Stephanas and Fortunatus and Achaicus have come, for they have made up for your absence;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="1Cor.16.18"><span class="verse-num">18&nbsp;</span>they have cheered my heart, and your hearts also. Recognise the worth of such men as these.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="1Cor.16.19"><span class="verse-num">19&nbsp;</span>The Churches in Roman Asia send you their greetings. Aquila and Prisca and the Church that meets at their house send you many Christian greetings.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="1Cor.16.20"><span class="verse-num">20&nbsp;</span>All our brothers send you greetings. Greet one another with a sacred kiss.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="1Cor.16.21"><span class="verse-num">21&nbsp;</span>I, Paul, add this greeting in my own handwriting.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="1Cor.16.22"><span class="verse-num">22&nbsp;</span>Accursed be any one who has no love for the Lord. THE LORD IS COMING.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="1Cor.16.23"><span class="verse-num">23&nbsp;</span>May the blessing of the Lord Jesus be with you.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="1Cor.16.24"><span class="verse-num">24&nbsp;</span>My love to all of you who are in union with Christ Jesus.</span>
