<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.10.1"><span class="verse-num verse-1">1&nbsp;</span>Calling his twelve Disciples to him, Jesus gave them authority over foul spirits, so that they could drive them out, as well as the power of curing every kind of disease and every kind of sickness.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.10.2"><span class="verse-num">2&nbsp;</span>The names of the twelve Apostles are these: First Simon, also known as Peter, and his brother Andrew; James the son of Zebediah, and his brother John;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.10.3"><span class="verse-num">3&nbsp;</span>Philip and Bartholomew; Thomas and Matthew the tax-gather; James the son of Alphaeus, and Thaddaeus;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.10.4"><span class="verse-num">4&nbsp;</span>Simon the Zealot, and Judas Iscariot &mdash; the Apostle who betrayed him.</span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.10.5"><span class="verse-num">5&nbsp;</span>These twelve Jesus sent out as his Messengers, after giving them these instructions &mdash; <span class="woc"> &ldquo;Do not go to the Gentiles, nor enter any Samaritan town,</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.10.6"><span class="verse-num">6&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> but make your way rather to the lost sheep of Israel.</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.10.7"><span class="verse-num">7&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> And on your way proclaim that the Kingdom of Heaven is at hand.</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.10.8"><span class="verse-num">8&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> Cure the sick, raise the dead, make the lepers clean, drive out demons. You have received free of cost, give free of cost.</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.10.9"><span class="verse-num">9&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> Do not provide yourselves with gold, or silver, or pence in your purses;</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.10.10"><span class="verse-num">10&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> not even with a bag for the journey, or a change of clothes, or sandals, or even a staff; for the worker is worth his food.</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.10.11"><span class="verse-num">11&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> Whatever town or village you visit, find out who is worthy in that place, and remain there till you leave.</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.10.12"><span class="verse-num">12&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> As you enter the house, greet it.</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.10.13"><span class="verse-num">13&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> Then, if the house is worthy, let your blessing rest upon it, but, if it is unworthy, let your blessing return upon yourselves.</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.10.14"><span class="verse-num">14&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> If no one welcomes you, or listens to what you say, as you leave that house or that town, shake off its dust from your feet.</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.10.15"><span class="verse-num">15&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> I tell you, the doom of the land of Sodom and Gomorrah will be more bearable in the &lsquo;Day of Judgment&rsquo; than the doom of that town.</span></span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.10.16"><span class="verse-num">16&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> Remember, I am sending you out as my Messengers like sheep among wolves. So be as wise as serpents, and as blameless as doves.</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.10.17"><span class="verse-num">17&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> Be on your guard against your fellow men, for they will betray you to courts of law, and scourge you in their Synagogues;</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.10.18"><span class="verse-num">18&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> and you will be brought before governors and kings for my sake, that you may witness for me before them and the nations.</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.10.19"><span class="verse-num">19&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> Whenever they betray you, do not be anxious as to how you shall speak or what you shall say, for what you shall say will be given you at the moment;</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.10.20"><span class="verse-num">20&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> for it will not be you who speak, but the Spirit of your Father that speaks within you.</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.10.21"><span class="verse-num">21&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> Brother will betray brother to death, and the father his child; and children will turn against their parents, and cause them to be put to death;</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.10.22"><span class="verse-num">22&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> and you will be hated by every one on account of my Name. Yet the man that endures to the end shall be saved.</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.10.23"><span class="verse-num">23&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> But, when they persecute you in one town, escape to the next; for, I tell you, you will not have come to the end of the towns of Israel before the Son of Man comes.</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.10.24"><span class="verse-num">24&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> A scholar is not above his teacher, nor a servant above his master.</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.10.25"><span class="verse-num">25&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> It is enough for a scholar to be treated like his teacher, and a servant like his master. If the head of the house has been called Baal-zebub, how much more the members of his household!</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.10.26"><span class="verse-num">26&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> Do not, therefore, be afraid of them. There is nothing concealed which will not be revealed, nor anything hidden which will not become known.</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.10.27"><span class="verse-num">27&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> What I tell you in the dark, say again in the light; and what is whispered in your ear, proclaim upon the housetops.</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.10.28"><span class="verse-num">28&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> And do not be afraid of those who kill the body, but are unable to kill the soul; rather be afraid of him who is able to destroy both soul and body in the Pit.</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.10.29"><span class="verse-num">29&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> Are not two sparrows sold for a half-penny? Yet not one of them will fall to the ground without your Father&rsquo;s knowledge.</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.10.30"><span class="verse-num">30&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> While as for you, the very hairs of your head are numbered.</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.10.31"><span class="verse-num">31&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> Do not, therefore, be afraid; you are of more value than many sparrows.</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.10.32"><span class="verse-num">32&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> Every one, therefore, who shall acknowledge me before his fellow men, I, too, will acknowledge before my Father who is in Heaven;</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.10.33"><span class="verse-num">33&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> but, if any one disowns me before his fellow men, I, too, will disown him before my Father who is in Heaven.</span></span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.10.34"><span class="verse-num">34&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> Do not imagine that I have come to bring peace upon the earth. I have come to bring, not peace, but the sword.</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.10.35"><span class="verse-num">35&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> For I have come to set &mdash; &lsquo;a man against his father, and a daughter against her mother, and a daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law.</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.10.36"><span class="verse-num">36&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> A man&rsquo;s enemies will be the members of his own household.&rsquo;</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.10.37"><span class="verse-num">37&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> He who loves father or mother more than me is not worthy of me; and he who loves son or daughter more than me is not worthy of me.</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.10.38"><span class="verse-num">38&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> And the man who does not take his cross and follow in my steps is not worthy of me.</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.10.39"><span class="verse-num">39&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> He who has found his life will lose it, while he who, for my sake, has lost his life shall find it.</span></span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.10.40"><span class="verse-num">40&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> He who welcomes you is welcoming me; and he who welcomes me is welcoming him who sent me as his Messenger.</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.10.41"><span class="verse-num">41&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> He who welcomes a Prophet, because he is a Prophet, shall receive a Prophet&rsquo;s reward; and he who welcomes a good man, because he is a good man, shall receive a good man&rsquo;s reward.</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.10.42"><span class="verse-num">42&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> And, if any one gives but a cup of cold water to one of these lowly ones because he is a disciple, I tell you that he shall assuredly not lose his reward.&rdquo; </span></span>
