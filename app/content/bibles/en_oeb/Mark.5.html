<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="Mark.5.1"><span class="verse-num verse-1">1&nbsp;</span>And they came to the other side of the Sea &mdash; the country of the Gerasenes;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Mark.5.2"><span class="verse-num">2&nbsp;</span>and, as soon as Jesus had got out of the boat, he met a man coming out of the tombs, who was under the power of a foul spirit,</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Mark.5.3"><span class="verse-num">3&nbsp;</span>and who made his home in the tombs. No one had ever been able to secure him, even with a chain;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Mark.5.4"><span class="verse-num">4&nbsp;</span>for, though he had many times been left secured with fetters and chains, he had snapped the chains and broken the fetters to pieces, and no one could master him.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Mark.5.5"><span class="verse-num">5&nbsp;</span>Night and day alike, he was continually shrieking in the tombs and among the hills, and cutting himself with stones.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Mark.5.6"><span class="verse-num">6&nbsp;</span>Catching sight of Jesus from a distance, he ran and bowed to the ground before him,</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Mark.5.7"><span class="verse-num">7&nbsp;</span>shrieking out in a loud voice: &ldquo;What do you want with me, Jesus, Son of the Most High God? For God&rsquo;s sake do not torment me!&rdquo;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Mark.5.8"><span class="verse-num">8&nbsp;</span>For Jesus had said: <span class="woc"> &ldquo;Come out from the man, you foul spirit.&rdquo;</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Mark.5.9"><span class="verse-num">9&nbsp;</span>And he asked him: <span class="woc"> &ldquo;What is your name?&rdquo;</span>  &rdquo;My name,&rdquo; he said, &rdquo;is Legion, for there are many of us;&rdquo;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Mark.5.10"><span class="verse-num">10&nbsp;</span>and he begged Jesus again and again not to send them away out of that country.</span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="Mark.5.11"><span class="verse-num">11&nbsp;</span>There was a large drove of pigs close by, feeding on the hillside.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Mark.5.12"><span class="verse-num">12&nbsp;</span>And the spirits begged Jesus: &ldquo;Send us into the pigs, that we may take possession of them.&rdquo;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Mark.5.13"><span class="verse-num">13&nbsp;</span>Jesus gave them leave. They came out, and entered into the pigs; and the drove &mdash; about two thousand in number &mdash; rushed down the steep slope into the Sea and were drowned in the Sea.</span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="Mark.5.14"><span class="verse-num">14&nbsp;</span>On this the men who tended them ran away, and carried the news to the town, and to the country round; and the people went to see what had happened.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Mark.5.15"><span class="verse-num">15&nbsp;</span>When they came to Jesus, they found the possessed man sitting there, clothed and in his right mind &mdash; the very man who had had the &lsquo;Legion&rsquo; in him &mdash; and they were awe-struck.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Mark.5.16"><span class="verse-num">16&nbsp;</span>Then those who had seen it related to them all that had happened to the possessed man, as well as about the pigs;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Mark.5.17"><span class="verse-num">17&nbsp;</span>upon which they began to beg Jesus to leave their neighbourhood.</span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="Mark.5.18"><span class="verse-num">18&nbsp;</span>As Jesus was getting into the boat, the possessed man begged him to let him stay with him.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Mark.5.19"><span class="verse-num">19&nbsp;</span>But Jesus refused. <span class="woc"> &ldquo;Go back to your home, to your own people,&rdquo;</span>  he said, <span class="woc"> &ldquo;and tell them of all that the Lord has done for you, and how he took pity on you.&rdquo;</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Mark.5.20"><span class="verse-num">20&nbsp;</span>So the man went, and began to proclaim in the district of the Ten Towns all that Jesus had done for him; and every one was amazed.</span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="Mark.5.21"><span class="verse-num">21&nbsp;</span>By the time Jesus had re-crossed in the boat to the opposite shore, a great number of people had gathered to meet him, and were standing by the Sea.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Mark.5.22"><span class="verse-num">22&nbsp;</span>And one of the Presidents of the Synagogue, whose name was Jaeirus, came and, as soon as he saw Jesus, threw himself at his feet with repeated entreaties.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Mark.5.23"><span class="verse-num">23&nbsp;</span>&ldquo;My little daughter,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;is at the point of death; I beg you to come and place your hands on her, that her life may be spared.&rdquo;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Mark.5.24"><span class="verse-num">24&nbsp;</span>So Jesus went with him. A great number of People followed Jesus, and kept pressing round him.</span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="Mark.5.25"><span class="verse-num">25&nbsp;</span>Meanwhile a woman who for twelve years had suffered from hemorrhage,</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Mark.5.26"><span class="verse-num">26&nbsp;</span>and undergone much at the hands of many doctors, (spending all she had without obtaining any relief, but, on the contrary, growing worse),</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Mark.5.27"><span class="verse-num">27&nbsp;</span>heard about Jesus, came behind in the crowd, and touched his cloak.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Mark.5.28"><span class="verse-num">28&nbsp;</span>&ldquo;If I can only touch his clothes,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I shall get well!&rdquo;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Mark.5.29"><span class="verse-num">29&nbsp;</span>At once the mischief was stopped, and she felt in herself that she was cured of her complaint.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Mark.5.30"><span class="verse-num">30&nbsp;</span>Jesus at once became aware of the power that had gone out from him, and, turning round in the crowd, he said: <span class="woc"> &ldquo;Who touched my clothes?&rdquo;</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Mark.5.31"><span class="verse-num">31&nbsp;</span>&ldquo;You see the people pressing round you,&rdquo; exclaimed his disciples, &ldquo;and yet you say <span class="woc"> &lsquo;Who touched me?&rsquo;&rdquo;</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Mark.5.32"><span class="verse-num">32&nbsp;</span>But Jesus looked about to see who had done it.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Mark.5.33"><span class="verse-num">33&nbsp;</span>Then the woman, in fear and trembling, knowing what had happened to her, came and threw herself down before him, and told him the whole truth.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Mark.5.34"><span class="verse-num">34&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> &ldquo;Daughter,&rdquo;</span>  he said, <span class="woc"> &ldquo;your faith has delivered you. Go, and peace be with you; be free from your complaint.&rdquo;</span></span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="Mark.5.35"><span class="verse-num">35&nbsp;</span>Before he had finished speaking, some people from the house of the President of the Synagogue came and said: &ldquo;Your daughter is dead! Why should you trouble the Teacher further?&rdquo;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Mark.5.36"><span class="verse-num">36&nbsp;</span>But Jesus, overhearing what they were saying, said to the President of the Synagogue: <span class="woc"> &ldquo;Do not be afraid; only have faith.&rdquo;</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Mark.5.37"><span class="verse-num">37&nbsp;</span>And he allowed no one to accompany him, except Peter, James, and John, the brother of James.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Mark.5.38"><span class="verse-num">38&nbsp;</span>Presently they reached the President&rsquo;s house, where Jesus saw a scene of confusion &mdash; people weeping and wailing incessantly.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Mark.5.39"><span class="verse-num">39&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> &ldquo;Why this confusion and weeping?&rdquo;</span>  he said on entering. <span class="woc"> &ldquo;The little child is not dead; she is asleep.&rdquo;</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Mark.5.40"><span class="verse-num">40&nbsp;</span>They began to laugh at him; but he sent them all out, and then, with the child&rsquo;s father and mother and his companions, went into the room where she was lying.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Mark.5.41"><span class="verse-num">41&nbsp;</span>Taking her hand, Jesus said to her: <span class="woc"> &ldquo;Taleitha, koum!&rdquo;</span>  &mdash; which means <span class="woc"> &lsquo;little girl, I am speaking to you &mdash; Rise!&rsquo;</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Mark.5.42"><span class="verse-num">42&nbsp;</span>The little girl stood up at once, and began to walk about; for she was twelve years old. And, as soon as they saw it, they were overwhelmed with amazement;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Mark.5.43"><span class="verse-num">43&nbsp;</span>but Jesus repeatedly cautioned them not to let any one know of it, and told them to give her something to eat.</span>
