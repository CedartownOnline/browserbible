<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="Mark.11.1"><span class="verse-num verse-1">1&nbsp;</span>When they had almost reached Jerusalem, as far as Bethphage and Bethany, near the Mount of Olives, Jesus sent on two of his disciples.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Mark.11.2"><span class="verse-num">2&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> &ldquo;Go to the village facing you,&rdquo;</span>  he said; <span class="woc"> &ldquo;and, as soon as you get there, you will find a foal tethered, which no one has ever ridden; untie it, and bring it.</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Mark.11.3"><span class="verse-num">3&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> And, if any one says to you &lsquo;Why are you doing that?&rsquo;, say &lsquo;The Master wants it, and will be sure to send it back here at once.&rsquo;&rdquo;</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Mark.11.4"><span class="verse-num">4&nbsp;</span>The two disciples went, and, finding a foal tethered outside a door in the street, they untied it.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Mark.11.5"><span class="verse-num">5&nbsp;</span>Some of the by-standers said to them: &ldquo;What are you doing, untying the foal?&rdquo;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Mark.11.6"><span class="verse-num">6&nbsp;</span>And the two disciples answered as Jesus had told them; and they allowed them to go.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Mark.11.7"><span class="verse-num">7&nbsp;</span>Then they brought the foal to Jesus, and, when they had laid their cloaks on it, he seated himself upon it.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Mark.11.8"><span class="verse-num">8&nbsp;</span>Many of the people spread their cloaks on the road, while some strewed boughs which they had cut from the fields;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Mark.11.9"><span class="verse-num">9&nbsp;</span>and those who led the way, as well as those who followed, kept shouting: &ldquo;&lsquo;God save him! Blessed is He who comes in the name of the Lord!&rsquo;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Mark.11.10"><span class="verse-num">10&nbsp;</span>Blessed is the coming Kingdom of our father David! &lsquo;God save him from on high!&rsquo;&rdquo;</span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="Mark.11.11"><span class="verse-num">11&nbsp;</span>Jesus entered Jerusalem, and went into the Temple Courts; and, after looking round at everything, as it was already late, he went out to Bethany with the Twelve.</span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="Mark.11.12"><span class="verse-num">12&nbsp;</span>The next day, after they had left Bethany, Jesus became hungry;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Mark.11.13"><span class="verse-num">13&nbsp;</span>and, noticing a fig-tree at a distance in leaf, he went to it to see if by any chance he could find something on it; but, on coming up to it, he found nothing but leaves, for it was not the season for figs.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Mark.11.14"><span class="verse-num">14&nbsp;</span>So, addressing the tree, he exclaimed: <span class="woc"> &ldquo;May no man ever again eat of your fruit!&rdquo;</span>  And his disciples heard what he said.</span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="Mark.11.15"><span class="verse-num">15&nbsp;</span>They came to Jerusalem. Jesus went into the Temple Courts, and began to drive out those who were buying and selling there. He overturned the tables of the money-changers, and the seats of the pigeon-dealers,</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Mark.11.16"><span class="verse-num">16&nbsp;</span>and would not allow any one to carry anything across the Temple Courts.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Mark.11.17"><span class="verse-num">17&nbsp;</span>Then he began to teach. <span class="woc"> &ldquo;Does not Scripture say,&rdquo;</span>  he asked, <span class="woc"> &ldquo;&lsquo;My House shall be called a House of Prayer for all the nations&rsquo;? But you have made it a den of robbers.&rsquo;&rdquo;</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Mark.11.18"><span class="verse-num">18&nbsp;</span>Now the Chief Priests and the Teachers of the Law heard this and began to look for some way of putting Jesus to death; for they were afraid of him, since all the people were greatly impressed by his teaching.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Mark.11.19"><span class="verse-num">19&nbsp;</span>As soon as evening fell, Jesus and his disciples went out of the city.</span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="Mark.11.20"><span class="verse-num">20&nbsp;</span>As they passed by early in the morning, they noticed that the fig-tree was withered up from the very roots.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Mark.11.21"><span class="verse-num">21&nbsp;</span>Then Peter recollected what had occurred. &ldquo;Look, Rabbi,&rdquo; he exclaimed, &ldquo;the fig-tree which you doomed is withered up!&rdquo;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Mark.11.22"><span class="verse-num">22&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> &ldquo;Have faith in God!&rdquo;</span>  replied Jesus.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Mark.11.23"><span class="verse-num">23&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> &ldquo;I tell you that if any one should say to this hill &lsquo;Be lifted up and hurled into the sea!&rsquo;, without ever a doubt in his mind, but in the faith that what he says will be done, he would find that it would be.</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Mark.11.24"><span class="verse-num">24&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> And therefore I say to you &lsquo;Have faith that whatever you ask for in prayer is already granted you, and you will find that it will be.&rsquo;</span></span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="Mark.11.25"><span class="verse-num">25&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> &lsquo;And, whenever you stand up to pray, forgive any grievance that you have against any one, that your Father who is in Heaven also may forgive you your offences.&rdquo;</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Mark.11.27"><span class="verse-num">27&nbsp;</span>They came to Jerusalem again. While Jesus was walking about in the Temple Courts, the Chief Priests, the Teachers of the Law, and the Councillors came up to him.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Mark.11.28"><span class="verse-num">28&nbsp;</span>&ldquo;What authority have you to do these things?&rdquo; they said. &ldquo;Who gave you the authority to do them?&rdquo;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Mark.11.29"><span class="verse-num">29&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> &ldquo;I will put one question to you,&rdquo;</span>  said Jesus. <span class="woc"> &ldquo;Answer me that, and then I will tell you what authority I have to act as I do.</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Mark.11.30"><span class="verse-num">30&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> It is about John&rsquo;s baptism. Was it of divine or human origin? Answer me that.&rdquo;</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Mark.11.31"><span class="verse-num">31&nbsp;</span>They began arguing together; &ldquo;If we say &lsquo;divine,&rsquo; he will say &lsquo;Why then did not you believe him?&rsquo;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Mark.11.32"><span class="verse-num">32&nbsp;</span>Yet can we say &lsquo;human&rsquo;?&rdquo; &mdash; They were afraid of the people, for everyone regarded John as undoubtedly a Prophet.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Mark.11.33"><span class="verse-num">33&nbsp;</span>So their answer to Jesus was &mdash; &ldquo;We do not know.&rdquo; <span class="woc"> &ldquo;Then I,&rdquo;</span>  replied Jesus, <span class="woc"> &ldquo;refuse to tell you what authority I have to do these things.&rdquo;</span></span>
