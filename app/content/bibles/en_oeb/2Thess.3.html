<span class="verse" data-osis="2Thess.3.1"><span class="verse-num verse-1">1&nbsp;</span>In conclusion, Brothers, pray for us &mdash; pray that the Lord&rsquo;s Message may spread rapidly, and be received everywhere with honour, as it was among you;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="2Thess.3.2"><span class="verse-num">2&nbsp;</span>and that we may be preserved from wrong-headed and wicked men- -for it is not every one who believes in Christ.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="2Thess.3.3"><span class="verse-num">3&nbsp;</span>But the Lord will not fail you; he will give you strength, and guard you from Evil.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="2Thess.3.4"><span class="verse-num">4&nbsp;</span>Yes, and the confidence that our union with the Lord enables us to place in you leads us to believe that you are doing, and will do, what we direct you.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="2Thess.3.5"><span class="verse-num">5&nbsp;</span>May the Lord bring you to the love of God, and to the patience of the Christ.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="2Thess.3.6"><span class="verse-num">6&nbsp;</span>We urge you, Brothers, in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, to avoid any Brother who is living an ill-ordered life, which is not in agreement with the teaching that you received from us.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="2Thess.3.7"><span class="verse-num">7&nbsp;</span>For you know well that you ought to follow our example. When we were with you, our life was not ill-ordered,</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="2Thess.3.8"><span class="verse-num">8&nbsp;</span>nor did we eat any one&rsquo;s bread without paying for it. Night and day, labouring and toiling, we used to work at our trades, so as not to be a burden upon any of you.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="2Thess.3.9"><span class="verse-num">9&nbsp;</span>This was not because we had not a right to receive support, but our object was to give you a pattern for you to copy.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="2Thess.3.10"><span class="verse-num">10&nbsp;</span>Indeed, when we were with you, what we urged upon you was &mdash;  &lsquo;If a man does not choose to work, then he shall not eat.&rsquo;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="2Thess.3.11"><span class="verse-num">11&nbsp;</span>We hear that there are among you people who are living ill- ordered lives, and who, instead of attending to their own business, are mere busy-bodies.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="2Thess.3.12"><span class="verse-num">12&nbsp;</span>All such people we urge, and entreat, in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, to attend quietly to their business, and earn their own living.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="2Thess.3.13"><span class="verse-num">13&nbsp;</span>You, Brothers, must not grow weary of doing what is right.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="2Thess.3.14"><span class="verse-num">14&nbsp;</span>If any one disregards what we have said in this letter, mark that man and avoid his company, that he may feel ashamed.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="2Thess.3.15"><span class="verse-num">15&nbsp;</span>Yet do not think of him as an enemy, but caution him as you would a Brother.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="2Thess.3.16"><span class="verse-num">16&nbsp;</span>May the Lord, from whom all peace comes, himself give you his peace at all times and in all ways. May he be with you all.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="2Thess.3.17"><span class="verse-num">17&nbsp;</span>I, Paul, add this greeting in my own handwriting. It is my signature to every letter. This is how I write.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="2Thess.3.18"><span class="verse-num">18&nbsp;</span>May the blessing of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all.</span>
