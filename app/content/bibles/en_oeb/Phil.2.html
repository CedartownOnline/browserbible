<h2 class="chapter-num">2</h2>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="Phil.2.1"><span class="verse-num verse-1">1&nbsp;</span>If, then, any encouragement comes through union with Christ, if there is any persuasive power in love, if there is any communion with the Spirit, if there is any tenderness or pity,</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Phil.2.2"><span class="verse-num">2&nbsp;</span>I entreat you to make my happiness complete &mdash; Live together animated by the same spirit and in mutual love, one in heart, animated by one Spirit.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Phil.2.3"><span class="verse-num">3&nbsp;</span>Nothing should be done in a factious spirit or from vanity, but each of you should with all humility regard others as of more account than himself,</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Phil.2.4"><span class="verse-num">4&nbsp;</span>and one and all should consider, not only their own interests, but also the interests of others.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Phil.2.5"><span class="verse-num">5&nbsp;</span>Let the spirit of Christ Jesus be yours also.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Phil.2.6"><span class="verse-num">6&nbsp;</span>Though the divine nature was his from the beginning, yet he did not look upon equality with God as above all things to be clung to,</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Phil.2.7"><span class="verse-num">7&nbsp;</span>but impoverished himself by taking the nature of a servant and becoming like men;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Phil.2.8"><span class="verse-num">8&nbsp;</span>he appeared among us as a man, and still further humbled himself by submitting even to death &mdash; to death on a cross!</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Phil.2.9"><span class="verse-num">9&nbsp;</span>And that is why God raised him to the very highest place, and gave him the Name which stands above all other names,</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Phil.2.10"><span class="verse-num">10&nbsp;</span>so that in adoration of the Name of Jesus every knee should bend, in Heaven, on earth, and under the earth,</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Phil.2.11"><span class="verse-num">11&nbsp;</span>and that every tongue should acknowledge JESUS CHRIST as LORD- -to the glory of God the Father.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Phil.2.12"><span class="verse-num">12&nbsp;</span>Therefore, my dear friends, as you have always been obedient in the past, so now work out your own Salvation with anxious care, not only when I am with you, but all the more now that I am absent.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Phil.2.13"><span class="verse-num">13&nbsp;</span>Remember it is God who, in his kindness, is at work within you, enabling you both to will and to work.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Phil.2.14"><span class="verse-num">14&nbsp;</span>In all that you do, avoid murmuring and dissension,</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Phil.2.15"><span class="verse-num">15&nbsp;</span>so as to prove yourselves blameless and innocent &mdash;  &lsquo;faultless children of God, in the midst of an evil-disposed and perverse generation,&rsquo; in which you are seen shining like stars in a dark world,</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Phil.2.16"><span class="verse-num">16&nbsp;</span>offering to men the Message of Life; and then I shall be able at the Day of Christ to boast that I did not run my course for nothing, or toil for nothing.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Phil.2.17"><span class="verse-num">17&nbsp;</span>And yet, even if, when your faith is offered as a sacrifice to God, my life-blood must be poured out in addition, still I shall rejoice and share the joy of you all;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Phil.2.18"><span class="verse-num">18&nbsp;</span>and do you also rejoice and share my joy.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Phil.2.19"><span class="verse-num">19&nbsp;</span>I hope, however, as one who trusts in the Lord Jesus, to send Timothy to you before long, so that I may myself be cheered by receiving news of you.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Phil.2.20"><span class="verse-num">20&nbsp;</span>For I have no one but him to send &mdash; no one of kindred spirit who would take the same genuine interest in your welfare.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Phil.2.21"><span class="verse-num">21&nbsp;</span>They are all pursuing their own aims and not those of Christ Jesus.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Phil.2.22"><span class="verse-num">22&nbsp;</span>But you know what Timothy has proved himself to be, and how, like a child working for his father, he worked hard with me in spreading the Good News.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Phil.2.23"><span class="verse-num">23&nbsp;</span>It is Timothy, then, whom I hope to send, as soon as ever I can foresee how it will go with me.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Phil.2.24"><span class="verse-num">24&nbsp;</span>And I am confident, as one who trusts in the Lord Jesus, that before long I myself shall follow.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Phil.2.25"><span class="verse-num">25&nbsp;</span>Still I think it necessary to send Epaphroditus to you now, for he is my brother, fellow-worker, and fellow-soldier, and he was also your messenger to help me in my need.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Phil.2.26"><span class="verse-num">26&nbsp;</span>For he has been longing to see you all, and has been distressed because you heard of his illness.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Phil.2.27"><span class="verse-num">27&nbsp;</span>And I can assure you that his illness very nearly proved fatal. But God had pity on him, and not on him only but also on me, that I might not have sorrow upon sorrow.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Phil.2.28"><span class="verse-num">28&nbsp;</span>I am all the more ready, therefore, to send him, so that the sight of him may revive your spirits and my own sorrow be lightened.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Phil.2.29"><span class="verse-num">29&nbsp;</span>Give him, then, the heartiest of Christian welcomes, and hold such men in great honour.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Phil.2.30"><span class="verse-num">30&nbsp;</span>For it was owing to his devotion to the Master&rsquo;s work that he was at the point of death, having risked his own life in the effort to supply what was wanting in the help that you sent me.</span>
