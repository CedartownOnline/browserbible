<h3>Paul’s Letter to Philemon</h3>
<h2 class="chapter-num">1</h2>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="Phlm.1.1"><span class="verse-num verse-1">1&nbsp;</span>From Paul, now a prisoner for Christ Jesus, and from Timothy, a Brother.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Phlm.1.2"><span class="verse-num">2&nbsp;</span>To our dear friend and fellow-worker Philemon, to our sister Apphia, to our fellow-soldier Archippus; and to the Church that meets at Philemon&rsquo;s house;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Phlm.1.3"><span class="verse-num">3&nbsp;</span>may God, our Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ bless you and give you peace.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Phlm.1.4"><span class="verse-num">4&nbsp;</span>I always mention you in my prayers and thank God for you,</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Phlm.1.5"><span class="verse-num">5&nbsp;</span>because I hear of the love and the faith which you show, not only to the Lord Jesus, but also to all his People;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Phlm.1.6"><span class="verse-num">6&nbsp;</span>and I pray that your participation in the Faith may result in action, as you come to a fuller realisation of everything that is good and Christlike in us.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Phlm.1.7"><span class="verse-num">7&nbsp;</span>I have indeed found great joy and encouragement in your love, knowing, as I do, how the hearts of Christ&rsquo;s People have been cheered, brother, by you.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Phlm.1.8"><span class="verse-num">8&nbsp;</span>And so, though my union with Christ enables me, with all confidence, to dictate the course that you should adopt,</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Phlm.1.9"><span class="verse-num">9&nbsp;</span>yet the claims of love make me prefer to plead with you &mdash; yes, even me, Paul, though I am an ambassador for Christ Jesus and, now a prisoner for him as well.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Phlm.1.10"><span class="verse-num">10&nbsp;</span>I plead with you for this Child of mine, Onesimus, to whom, in my parson, I have become a Father.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Phlm.1.11"><span class="verse-num">11&nbsp;</span>Once he was of little service to you, but now he has become of great service, not only to you, but to me as well;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Phlm.1.12"><span class="verse-num">12&nbsp;</span>and I am sending him back to you with this letter &mdash; though it is like tearing out of my very heart.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Phlm.1.13"><span class="verse-num">13&nbsp;</span>For my own sake I should like to keep him with me, so that, while I am in prison for the Good News, he might attend to my wants on your behalf.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Phlm.1.14"><span class="verse-num">14&nbsp;</span>But I do not wish to do anything without your consent, because I want your generosity to be voluntary and not, as it were, compulsory.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Phlm.1.15"><span class="verse-num">15&nbsp;</span>It may be that he was separated from you for an hour, for this very reason, that you might have him back for ever,</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Phlm.1.16"><span class="verse-num">16&nbsp;</span>no longer as a slave, but as something better &mdash; a dearly loved Brother, especially dear to me, and how much more so to you, not only as your fellow man, but as your fellow Christian!</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Phlm.1.17"><span class="verse-num">17&nbsp;</span>If, then, you count me your friend, receive him as you would me.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Phlm.1.18"><span class="verse-num">18&nbsp;</span>If he has caused you any loss, or owes you anything, charge it to me.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Phlm.1.19"><span class="verse-num">19&nbsp;</span>I, Paul, put my own hand to it &mdash; I will repay you myself. I say nothing about your owing me your very self.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Phlm.1.20"><span class="verse-num">20&nbsp;</span>Yes, Brother, let me gain something from you because of your union with the Lord. Cheer my heart by your Christlike spirit.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Phlm.1.21"><span class="verse-num">21&nbsp;</span>Even as I write, I have such confidence in your compliance with my wishes, that I am sure that you will do even more than I am asking.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Phlm.1.22"><span class="verse-num">22&nbsp;</span>Please also get a lodging ready for me, for I hope that I shall be given back to you all in answer to your prayers.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Phlm.1.23"><span class="verse-num">23&nbsp;</span>Epaphras, who is my fellow-prisoner for Christ Jesus, sends you his greeting;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Phlm.1.24"><span class="verse-num">24&nbsp;</span>and Marcus, Aristarchus, Demas, and Luke, my fellow-workers, send theirs.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Phlm.1.25"><span class="verse-num">25&nbsp;</span>May the blessing of the Lord Jesus Christ rest on your souls.</span>
