<p>
<span class="verse Matt_21_1" data-osis="Matt.21.1"><span class="verse-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span>When they had almost reached Jerusalem, having come as far as Bethphage, on the Mount of Olives, Jesus sent on two disciples.</span>
<span class="verse Matt_21_2" data-osis="Matt.21.2"><span class="verse-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> &ldquo;Go to the village facing you,&rdquo; </span>  he said, <span class="woc"> &ldquo;and you will immediately find an ass tethered, with a foal by her side; untie her, and lead her here for me.</span></span>
<span class="verse Matt_21_3" data-osis="Matt.21.3"><span class="verse-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> And, if any one says anything to you, you are to say this &mdash;  &lsquo;The Master wants them&rsquo;; and he will send them at once.&rdquo; </span></span>
<span class="verse Matt_21_4" data-osis="Matt.21.4"><span class="verse-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span>This happened in fulfilment of these words in the Prophet &mdash;</span>
<span class="verse Matt_21_5" data-osis="Matt.21.5"><span class="verse-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span>&lsquo;Say to the daughter of Zion &mdash; &ldquo;Behold, thy King is coming to thee, Gentle, and riding on an ass, and on the foal of a beast of burden.&rdquo;&rsquo;</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Matt_21_6" data-osis="Matt.21.6"><span class="verse-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span>So the disciples went and did as Jesus had directed them.</span>
<span class="verse Matt_21_7" data-osis="Matt.21.7"><span class="verse-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span>They led the ass and the foal back, and, when they had put their cloaks on them, he seated himself upon them.</span>
<span class="verse Matt_21_8" data-osis="Matt.21.8"><span class="verse-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span>The immense crowd of people spread their cloaks in the road, while some cut branches off the trees, and spread them on the road.</span>
<span class="verse Matt_21_9" data-osis="Matt.21.9"><span class="verse-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span>The crowds that led the way, as well as those that followed behind, kept shouting: &ldquo;God save the Son of David! Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord! God save him from on high!&rdquo;</span>
<span class="verse Matt_21_10" data-osis="Matt.21.10"><span class="verse-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span>When he had entered Jerusalem, the whole city was stirred, and asked &mdash;</span>
<span class="verse Matt_21_11" data-osis="Matt.21.11"><span class="verse-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span>&ldquo;Who is this?&rdquo;, to which the crowd replied &mdash; &ldquo;This is the Prophet Jesus from Nazareth in Galilee.&rdquo;</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Matt_21_12" data-osis="Matt.21.12"><span class="verse-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span>Jesus went into the Temple Courts, and drove out all those who were buying and selling there. He overturned the tables of the money-changers, and the seats of the pigeon-dealers,</span>
<span class="verse Matt_21_13" data-osis="Matt.21.13"><span class="verse-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span>and said to them: <span class="woc"> &ldquo;Scripture says &lsquo;My House shall be called a house of prayer&rsquo;; but you are making it &lsquo;a den of robbers.&rsquo;&rdquo; </span></span>
<span class="verse Matt_21_14" data-osis="Matt.21.14"><span class="verse-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span>While he was still in the Temple Courts, some blind and some lame people came up to him, and he cured them.</span>
<span class="verse Matt_21_15" data-osis="Matt.21.15"><span class="verse-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span>But, when the Chief Priests and the Teachers of the Law saw the wonderful things that Jesus did, and the boys who were calling out in the Temple Courts &ldquo;God save the Son of David!&rdquo;, they were indignant,</span>
<span class="verse Matt_21_16" data-osis="Matt.21.16"><span class="verse-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span>and said to him: &ldquo;Do you hear what these boys are saying?&rdquo; <span class="woc"> &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; </span>  answered Jesus; <span class="woc"> &ldquo;but did you never read the words &mdash; &lsquo;Out of the mouths of babes and sucklings thou hast called forth perfect praise&rsquo;?&rdquo; </span></span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Matt_21_17" data-osis="Matt.21.17"><span class="verse-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span>Then he left them, and went out of the city to Bethany, and spent the night there.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Matt_21_18" data-osis="Matt.21.18"><span class="verse-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span>The next morning, in returning to the city, Jesus became hungry;</span>
<span class="verse Matt_21_19" data-osis="Matt.21.19"><span class="verse-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span>and, noticing a solitary fig tree by the road-side, he went up to it, but found nothing on it but leaves. So he said to it: <span class="woc"> &ldquo;Never again shall fruit be gathered off you.&rdquo; </span>  And suddenly the fruit tree withered up.</span>
<span class="verse Matt_21_20" data-osis="Matt.21.20"><span class="verse-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span>When the disciples saw this, they exclaimed in astonishment: &ldquo;How suddenly the fig tree withered up!&rdquo;</span>
<span class="verse Matt_21_21" data-osis="Matt.21.21"><span class="verse-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> &ldquo;I tell you,&rdquo; </span>  replied Jesus, <span class="woc"> &ldquo;if you have faith, without ever a doubt, you will do what not only what has been done to the fig tree, but, even if you should say to this hill &lsquo;Be lifted up and hurled into the sea!&rsquo; it would be done.</span></span>
<span class="verse Matt_21_22" data-osis="Matt.21.22"><span class="verse-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> And whatever you ask for in your prayers will, if you have faith, be granted you.&rdquo; </span></span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Matt_21_23" data-osis="Matt.21.23"><span class="verse-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span>After Jesus had come into the Temple Courts, the Chief Priests and the Councillors of the Nation came up to him as he was teaching, and said: &ldquo; What authority have you to do these things? Who gave you this authority?&rdquo;</span>
<span class="verse Matt_21_24" data-osis="Matt.21.24"><span class="verse-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> &ldquo;I, too,&rdquo; </span>  said Jesus in reply, <span class="woc"> &ldquo;will ask you one question; if you will give me an answer to it, then I, also, will tell you what authority I have to act as I do.</span></span>
<span class="verse Matt_21_25" data-osis="Matt.21.25"><span class="verse-num v-25">25&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> It is about John&rsquo;s baptism. What was its origin? divine or human?&rdquo; But they began arguing among themselves: &ldquo;If we say &lsquo;divine,&rsquo; he will say to us &lsquo;Why then did not you believe him?&rsquo;</span></span>
<span class="verse Matt_21_26" data-osis="Matt.21.26"><span class="verse-num v-26">26&nbsp;</span>But if we say &lsquo;human,&rsquo; we are afraid of the people, for every one regards John as a Prophet.&rdquo;</span>
<span class="verse Matt_21_27" data-osis="Matt.21.27"><span class="verse-num v-27">27&nbsp;</span>So the answer they gave Jesus was &mdash; &ldquo;We do not know.&rdquo; <span class="woc"> &ldquo;Then I,&rdquo; </span>  he said, <span class="woc"> &ldquo;refuse to tell you what authority I have to do these things.</span></span>
<span class="verse Matt_21_28" data-osis="Matt.21.28"><span class="verse-num v-28">28&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> What do you think of this? There was a man who had two sons. He went to the elder and said &lsquo;Go and work in the vineyard to-day my son.&rsquo;</span></span>
<span class="verse Matt_21_29" data-osis="Matt.21.29"><span class="verse-num v-29">29&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> &lsquo;Yes, sir,&rsquo; he answered; but he did not go.</span></span>
<span class="verse Matt_21_30" data-osis="Matt.21.30"><span class="verse-num v-30">30&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> Then the father went to the second son, and said the same. &lsquo;I will not,&rsquo; he answered; but afterwards he was sorry and went.</span></span>
<span class="verse Matt_21_31" data-osis="Matt.21.31"><span class="verse-num v-31">31&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> Which of the two sons did as his father wished?&rdquo; </span>  &ldquo; The second,&rdquo; they said. <span class="woc"> &ldquo;I tell you,&rdquo; </span>  added Jesus, <span class="woc"> &ldquo;that tax-gatherers and prostitutes are going into the Kingdom of God before you.</span></span>
<span class="verse Matt_21_32" data-osis="Matt.21.32"><span class="verse-num v-32">32&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> For when John came to you, walking in the path of righteousness, you did not believe him, but tax-gatherers and prostitutes did; and yet you, though you saw this, even then were not sorry, nor did you believe him.</span></span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Matt_21_33" data-osis="Matt.21.33"><span class="verse-num v-33">33&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> Listen to another parable. A man, who was an employer, once planted a vineyard, put a fence round it, dug a winepress in it, built a tower, and then let it out to tenants and went abroad.</span></span>
<span class="verse Matt_21_34" data-osis="Matt.21.34"><span class="verse-num v-34">34&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> When the time for the vintage drew near, he sent his servants to the tenants, to receive his share of the produce.</span></span>
<span class="verse Matt_21_35" data-osis="Matt.21.35"><span class="verse-num v-35">35&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> But the tenants seized his servants, beat one, killed another, and stoned a third.</span></span>
<span class="verse Matt_21_36" data-osis="Matt.21.36"><span class="verse-num v-36">36&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> A second time the owner sent some servants, a larger number than before, and the tenants treated them in the same way.</span></span>
<span class="verse Matt_21_37" data-osis="Matt.21.37"><span class="verse-num v-37">37&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> As a last resource he sent his son to them. &lsquo;They will respect my son,&rsquo; he said.</span></span>
<span class="verse Matt_21_38" data-osis="Matt.21.38"><span class="verse-num v-38">38&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> But the tenants, on seeing his son, said to each other &lsquo;Here is the heir! Come, let us kill him, and get his inheritance.&rsquo;</span></span>
<span class="verse Matt_21_39" data-osis="Matt.21.39"><span class="verse-num v-39">39&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> So they seized him, and threw him outside the vineyard, and killed him.</span></span>
<span class="verse Matt_21_40" data-osis="Matt.21.40"><span class="verse-num v-40">40&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> Now, when the owner of the vineyard comes, what will he do to those tenants?&rdquo; </span></span>
<span class="verse Matt_21_41" data-osis="Matt.21.41"><span class="verse-num v-41">41&nbsp;</span>&ldquo;Miserable wretches!&rdquo; they exclaimed, &ldquo;he will put them to a miserable death, and he will let out the vineyard to other tenants, who will pay him his share of the produce at the proper times.&rdquo;</span>
<span class="verse Matt_21_42" data-osis="Matt.21.42"><span class="verse-num v-42">42&nbsp;</span>Then Jesus added: <span class="woc"> &ldquo;Have you never read in the Scriptures? &mdash;  &lsquo;The very stone which the builders despised &mdash; Has now itself become the corner-stone; This corner-stone has come from the Lord, and is marvellous in our eyes.&rsquo;</span></span>
<span class="verse Matt_21_43" data-osis="Matt.21.43"><span class="verse-num v-43">43&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> And that, I tell you, is why the Kingdom of God will be taken from you, and given to a nation that does produce the fruit of the Kingdom.</span></span>
<span class="verse Matt_21_44" data-osis="Matt.21.44"><span class="verse-num v-44">44&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> Yes, and he who falls on this stone will be dashed to pieces, while any one on whom it falls &mdash; it will scatter him as dust.&rdquo; </span></span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Matt_21_45" data-osis="Matt.21.45"><span class="verse-num v-45">45&nbsp;</span>After listening to these parables, the Chief Priests and the Pharisees saw that it was about them that he was speaking;</span>
<span class="verse Matt_21_46" data-osis="Matt.21.46"><span class="verse-num v-46">46&nbsp;</span>yet, although eager to arrest him, they were afraid of the crowds, who regarded him as a Prophet.</span>
