<span class="verse" data-osis="Jas.3.1"><span class="verse-num verse-1">1&nbsp;</span>I do not want many of you, my Brothers, to become teachers, knowing, as you do, that we who teach shall be judged by a more severe standard than others.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Jas.3.2"><span class="verse-num">2&nbsp;</span>We often make mistakes, every one of us. Any one who does not make mistakes when speaking is indeed a perfect man, able to bridle his whole body as well.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Jas.3.3"><span class="verse-num">3&nbsp;</span>When we put bits into horses&rsquo; mouths, to make them obey us, we control the rest of their bodies so.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Jas.3.4"><span class="verse-num">4&nbsp;</span>Again, think of ships. Large as they are, and even when driven by fierce winds, they are controlled by a very small rudder and steered in whatever direction the man at the helm may determine.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Jas.3.5"><span class="verse-num">5&nbsp;</span>So is it with the tongue. Small as it is, it is a great boaster. Think how tiny a spark may set the largest forest ablaze!</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Jas.3.6"><span class="verse-num">6&nbsp;</span>And the tongue is like a spark. Among the members of our body it proves itself a very world of mischief; it contaminates the whole body; it sets the wheels of life on fire, and is itself set on fire by the flames of the Pit.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Jas.3.7"><span class="verse-num">7&nbsp;</span>For while all sorts of beasts and birds, and of reptiles and creatures in the sea, are tameable, and actually have been tamed by man,</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Jas.3.8"><span class="verse-num">8&nbsp;</span>no human being can tame the tongue. It is a restless plague! It is charged with deadly poison!</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Jas.3.9"><span class="verse-num">9&nbsp;</span>With it we bless our Lord and Father, and with it we curse men who are made &lsquo;in God&rsquo;s likeness.&rsquo;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Jas.3.10"><span class="verse-num">10&nbsp;</span>From the very same mouth come blessings and curses! My Brothers, it is not right that this should be so.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Jas.3.11"><span class="verse-num">11&nbsp;</span>Does a spring give both good and bad water from the same source?</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Jas.3.12"><span class="verse-num">12&nbsp;</span>Can a fig tree, my Brothers, bear olives? or a vine bear figs? No, nor can a brackish well give good water.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Jas.3.13"><span class="verse-num">13&nbsp;</span>Who among you claims to be wise and intelligent? Let him show that his actions are the outcome of a good life lived in the humility of true wisdom.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Jas.3.14"><span class="verse-num">14&nbsp;</span>But, while you harbour envy and bitterness and a spirit of rivalry in your hearts, do not boast or lie to the detriment of the Truth.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Jas.3.15"><span class="verse-num">15&nbsp;</span>That is not the wisdom which comes from above; no, it is earthly, animal, devilish.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Jas.3.16"><span class="verse-num">16&nbsp;</span>For, where envy and rivalry exist, there you will also find disorder and all kinds of base actions.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Jas.3.17"><span class="verse-num">17&nbsp;</span>But the wisdom from above is, before every thing else, pure; then peace-loving, gentle, open to conviction, rich in compassion and good deeds, and free from partiality and insincerity.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Jas.3.18"><span class="verse-num">18&nbsp;</span>And righteousness, its fruit, is sown in peace by those who work for peace.</span>
