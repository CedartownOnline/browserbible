<h2 class="chapter-num">26</h2>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.26.1"><span class="verse-num verse-1">1&nbsp;</span>When Jesus had finished all this teaching, he said to his disciples:</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.26.2"><span class="verse-num">2&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> &ldquo;You know that in two days time the Festival of the Passover will be here; and that the Son of Man is to be given up to be crucified.&rdquo; </span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.26.3"><span class="verse-num">3&nbsp;</span>Then the Chief Priests and the Councillors of the Nation met in the house of the High Priest, who was called Caiaphas,</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.26.4"><span class="verse-num">4&nbsp;</span>and plotted together to arrest Jesus by stealth and put him to death;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.26.5"><span class="verse-num">5&nbsp;</span>but they said: &ldquo;Not during the Festival, for fear of causing a riot.&rdquo;</span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.26.6"><span class="verse-num">6&nbsp;</span>After Jesus had reached Bethany, and while he was in the house of Simon the leper,</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.26.7"><span class="verse-num">7&nbsp;</span>a woman came up to him with an alabaster jar of very costly perfume, and poured the perfume upon his head as he was at table.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.26.8"><span class="verse-num">8&nbsp;</span>The disciples were indignant at seeing this. &ldquo;What is this waste for?&rdquo; they exclaimed.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.26.9"><span class="verse-num">9&nbsp;</span>&ldquo;It could have been sold for a large sum, and the money given to poor people.&rdquo;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.26.10"><span class="verse-num">10&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> &ldquo;Why are you troubling the woman?&rdquo; </span>  Jesus said, when he noticed it. <span class="woc"> &ldquo;For this is a beautiful deed that she has done to me.</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.26.11"><span class="verse-num">11&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> You always have the poor with you, but you will not always have me.</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.26.12"><span class="verse-num">12&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> In pouring this perfume on my body, she has done it for my burying.</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.26.13"><span class="verse-num">13&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> I tell you, wherever, in the whole world, this Good News is proclaimed, what this woman has done will be told in memory of her.&rdquo; </span></span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.26.14"><span class="verse-num">14&nbsp;</span>It was then that one of the Twelve, named Judas Iscariot, made his way to the Chief Priests,</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.26.15"><span class="verse-num">15&nbsp;</span>and said &ldquo;What are you willing to give me, if I betray Jesus to you?&rdquo; The Priests &lsquo;weighed him out thirty pieces of silver&rsquo; as payment.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.26.16"><span class="verse-num">16&nbsp;</span>So from that time Judas looked for an opportunity to betray Jesus.</span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.26.17"><span class="verse-num">17&nbsp;</span>On the first day of the Festival of the Unleavened Bread, the disciples came up to Jesus, and said: &ldquo;Where do you wish us to make preparations for you to eat the Passover?&rdquo;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.26.18"><span class="verse-num">18&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> &ldquo;Go into the city to a certain man,&rdquo; </span>  he answered, <span class="woc"> &ldquo;and say to him &lsquo;The Teacher says &mdash; My time is near. I will keep the Passover with my disciples at your house.&rsquo;&rdquo; </span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.26.19"><span class="verse-num">19&nbsp;</span>The disciples did as Jesus directed them, and prepared the Passover.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.26.20"><span class="verse-num">20&nbsp;</span>In the evening Jesus took his place with the twelve disciples,</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.26.21"><span class="verse-num">21&nbsp;</span>and, while they were eating, he said: <span class="woc"> &ldquo;I tell you that one of you will betray me.&rdquo; </span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.26.22"><span class="verse-num">22&nbsp;</span>In great grief they began to say to him, one by one: &ldquo;Can it be I, Master?&rdquo;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.26.23"><span class="verse-num">23&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> &ldquo;The one who dipped his bread beside me in the dish,&rdquo; </span>  replied Jesus, <span class="woc"> &ldquo;is the one who will betray me.</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.26.24"><span class="verse-num">24&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> True, the Son of Man must go, as Scripture says of him, yet alas for that man by whom the Son of Man is being betrayed! For that man &lsquo;it would be better never to have been born!&rsquo;&rdquo; </span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.26.25"><span class="verse-num">25&nbsp;</span>And Judas, who was betraying him, turned to him and said: &ldquo;Can it be I, Rabbi?&rdquo; <span class="woc"> &ldquo;It is,&rdquo; </span>  answered Jesus.</span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.26.26"><span class="verse-num">26&nbsp;</span>While they were eating, Jesus took some bread, and, after saying the blessing, broke it and, as he gave it to his disciples, said: <span class="woc"> &ldquo;Take it and eat it; this is my body.&rdquo; </span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.26.27"><span class="verse-num">27&nbsp;</span>Then he took a cup, and, after saying the thanksgiving, gave it to them, with the words: <span class="woc"> &ldquo;Drink from it, all of you;</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.26.28"><span class="verse-num">28&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> for this is my Covenant blood, which is poured out for many for the forgiveness of sins.</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.26.29"><span class="verse-num">29&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> And I tell you that I shall never, after this, drink of this juice of the grape, until that day when I shall drink it new with you in the Kingdom of my Father.&rdquo; </span></span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.26.30"><span class="verse-num">30&nbsp;</span>They then sang a hymn, and went out to the Mount of Olives.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.26.31"><span class="verse-num">31&nbsp;</span>Then Jesus said to them: <span class="woc"> &ldquo;Even you will all fall away from me to-night. Scripture says &mdash; &lsquo;I will strike down the shepherd, and the sheep of the flock will be scattered.&rsquo;</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.26.32"><span class="verse-num">32&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> But, after I have risen, I shall go before you into Galilee.&rdquo; </span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.26.33"><span class="verse-num">33&nbsp;</span>&ldquo;If every one else falls away from you,&rdquo; Peter answered, &ldquo;I shall never fall away!&rdquo;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.26.34"><span class="verse-num">34&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> &ldquo;I tell you,&rdquo; </span>  replied Jesus, <span class="woc"> &ldquo;that this very night, before the cock crows, you will disown me three times!&rdquo; </span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.26.35"><span class="verse-num">35&nbsp;</span>&ldquo;Even if I must die with you,&rdquo; Peter exclaimed, &ldquo;I shall never disown you!&rdquo; All the disciples spoke in the same way.</span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.26.36"><span class="verse-num">36&nbsp;</span>Then Jesus came with them to a garden called Gethsemane, and he said to his disciples: <span class="woc"> &ldquo;Sit down here while I go and pray yonder.&rdquo; </span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.26.37"><span class="verse-num">37&nbsp;</span>Taking with him Peter and the two sons of Zebediah, he began to show signs of sadness and deep distress of mind.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.26.38"><span class="verse-num">38&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> &ldquo;I am sad at heart,&rdquo; </span>  he said, <span class="woc"> &ldquo;sad even to death; wait here and watch with me.&rdquo; </span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.26.39"><span class="verse-num">39&nbsp;</span>Going on a little further, he threw himself on his face in prayer. <span class="woc"> &ldquo;My Father,&rdquo; </span>  he said, <span class="woc"> &ldquo;if it is possible, let me be spared this cup; only, not as I will, but as thou willest.&rdquo; </span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.26.40"><span class="verse-num">40&nbsp;</span>Then he came to his disciples, and found them asleep. <span class="woc"> &ldquo;What!&rdquo; </span>  he said to Peter, <span class="woc"> &ldquo;could none of you watch with me for one hour?</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.26.41"><span class="verse-num">41&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> Watch and pray, that you may not fall into temptation. True, the spirit is eager, but human nature is weak.&rdquo; </span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.26.42"><span class="verse-num">42&nbsp;</span>Again, a second time, he went away, and prayed. <span class="woc"> &ldquo;My Father,&rdquo; </span>  he said, <span class="woc"> &ldquo;if I cannot be spared this cup, but must drink it, thy will be done!&rdquo; </span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.26.43"><span class="verse-num">43&nbsp;</span>And coming back again he found them asleep, for their eyes were heavy.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.26.44"><span class="verse-num">44&nbsp;</span>So he left them, and went away again, and prayed a third time, again saying the same words.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.26.45"><span class="verse-num">45&nbsp;</span>Then he came to the disciples, and said: <span class="woc"> &ldquo;Sleep on now, and rest yourselves. Hark! my time is close at hand, and the Son of Man is being betrayed into the hands of wicked men.</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.26.46"><span class="verse-num">46&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> Up, and let us be going. Look! my betrayer is close at hand.&rdquo; </span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.26.47"><span class="verse-num">47&nbsp;</span>And, while he was still speaking, Judas, who was one of the Twelve, came in sight; and with him was a great crowd of people, with swords and clubs, sent from the Chief Priests and Councillors of the Nation.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.26.48"><span class="verse-num">48&nbsp;</span>Now the betrayer had arranged a signal with them. &ldquo;The man whom I kiss,&rdquo; he had said, &ldquo;will be the one; arrest him.&rdquo;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.26.49"><span class="verse-num">49&nbsp;</span>So he went up to Jesus at once, and exclaimed: &ldquo;Welcome, Rabbi!&rdquo; and kissed him;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.26.50"><span class="verse-num">50&nbsp;</span>on which Jesus said to him: <span class="woc"> &ldquo;Friend, do what you have come for.&rdquo; </span>  Thereupon the men went up, seized Jesus, and arrested him.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.26.51"><span class="verse-num">51&nbsp;</span>Suddenly one of those who were with Jesus stretched out his hand, and drew his sword, and striking the High Priest&rsquo;s servant, cut off his ear.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.26.52"><span class="verse-num">52&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> &ldquo;Sheathe your sword,&rdquo; </span>  Jesus said, <span class="woc"> &ldquo;for all who draw the sword will be put to the sword.</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.26.53"><span class="verse-num">53&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> Do you think that I cannot ask my Father for help, when he would at once send to my aid more than twelve legions of angels?</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.26.54"><span class="verse-num">54&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> But in that case how would the Scriptures be fulfilled, which say that this must be?&rdquo; </span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.26.55"><span class="verse-num">55&nbsp;</span>Jesus at the same time said to the crowds: <span class="woc"> &ldquo;Have you come out, as if after a robber, with swords and clubs, to take me? I have sat teaching day after day in the Temple Courts, and yet you did not arrest me.&rdquo; </span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.26.56"><span class="verse-num">56&nbsp;</span>The whole of this occurred in fulfilment of the Prophetic Scriptures. Then the disciples all forsook him and fled.</span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.26.57"><span class="verse-num">57&nbsp;</span>Those who had arrested Jesus took him to Caiaphas, the High Priest, where the Teachers of the Law and the Councillors had assembled.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.26.58"><span class="verse-num">58&nbsp;</span>Peter followed him at a distance as far as the courtyard of the offices, to see the end.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.26.59"><span class="verse-num">59&nbsp;</span>Meanwhile the Chief Priests and the whole of the High Council were trying to get such false evidence against Jesus, as would warrant putting him to death,</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.26.60"><span class="verse-num">60&nbsp;</span>but they did not find any, although many came forward with false evidence. Later on, however, two men came forward and said:</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.26.61"><span class="verse-num">61&nbsp;</span>&ldquo;This man said &lsquo;I am able to destroy the Temple of God, and to build it in three days.&rsquo;&rdquo;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.26.62"><span class="verse-num">62&nbsp;</span>Then the High Priest stood up, and said to Jesus: &ldquo;Have you no answer? What is this evidence which these men are giving against you?&rdquo;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.26.63"><span class="verse-num">63&nbsp;</span>But Jesus remained silent. On this the High Priest said to him: &ldquo;I adjure you, by the Living God, to tell us whether you are the Christ, the Son of God.&rdquo;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.26.64"><span class="verse-num">64&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> &ldquo;It is true,&rdquo; </span>  Jesus answered; <span class="woc"> &ldquo;Moreover I tell you all that hereafter you shall &lsquo;see the Son of Man sitting on the right hand of the Almighty, and coming on the clouds of the heavens.&rsquo;&rdquo; </span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.26.65"><span class="verse-num">65&nbsp;</span>Then the High Priest tore his robes. &ldquo;This is blasphemy!&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;Why do we want any more witnesses? You have just heard his blasphemy!</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.26.66"><span class="verse-num">66&nbsp;</span>What is your decision?&rdquo; They answered: &ldquo;He deserves death.&rdquo;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.26.67"><span class="verse-num">67&nbsp;</span>Then they spat in his face, and struck him, while others dealt blows at him, saying as they did so:</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.26.68"><span class="verse-num">68&nbsp;</span>&ldquo;Now play the Prophet for us, you Christ! Who was it that struck you?&rdquo;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.26.69"><span class="verse-num">69&nbsp;</span>Peter, meanwhile, was sitting outside in the courtyard; and a maidservant came up to him, and exclaimed: &ldquo;Why, you were with Jesus the Galilean!&rdquo;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.26.70"><span class="verse-num">70&nbsp;</span>But Peter denied it before them all. &ldquo;I do not know what you mean,&rdquo; he replied.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.26.71"><span class="verse-num">71&nbsp;</span>When he had gone out into the gateway, another maid saw him, and said to those who were there: &ldquo;This man was with Jesus of Nazareth!&rdquo;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.26.72"><span class="verse-num">72&nbsp;</span>Again he denied it with an oath: &ldquo;I do not know the man!&rdquo;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.26.73"><span class="verse-num">73&nbsp;</span>But soon afterwards those who were standing by came up and said to Peter: &ldquo;You also are certainly one of them; why, your very way of speaking proves it!&rdquo;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.26.74"><span class="verse-num">74&nbsp;</span>Then Peter began to swear, with most solemn imprecations: &ldquo;I do not know the man.&rdquo; At that moment a cock crowed;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.26.75"><span class="verse-num">75&nbsp;</span>and Peter remembered the words which Jesus had said &mdash; <span class="woc"> &lsquo;Before a cock has crowed, you will disown me three times&rsquo;;</span>  and he went outside, and wept bitterly.</span>
