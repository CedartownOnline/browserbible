<span class="verse Matt_15_1" data-osis="Matt.15.1"><span class="verse-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span>Then some Pharisees and Teachers of the Law came to Jesus, and said:</span>
<span class="verse Matt_15_2" data-osis="Matt.15.2"><span class="verse-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span>&ldquo;How is it that your disciples break the traditions of our ancestors? For they do not wash their hands when they eat food.&rdquo;</span>
<span class="verse Matt_15_3" data-osis="Matt.15.3"><span class="verse-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span>His reply was: <span class="woc"> &ldquo;How is it that you on your side break God&rsquo;s commandments out of respect for your own traditions?</span></span>
<span class="verse Matt_15_4" data-osis="Matt.15.4"><span class="verse-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> For God said &mdash; &lsquo;Honour thy father and mother,&rsquo; and &lsquo;Let him who reviles his father or mother suffer death,&rsquo;</span></span>
<span class="verse Matt_15_5" data-osis="Matt.15.5"><span class="verse-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> but you say &lsquo;Whenever any one says to his father or mother &ldquo;Whatever of mine might have been of service to you is &lsquo;Given to God,&rsquo;&rdquo; </span></span>
<span class="verse Matt_15_6" data-osis="Matt.15.6"><span class="verse-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> he is in no way bound to honour his father.&rsquo; In this way you have nullified the words of God on account of your traditions.</span></span>
<span class="verse Matt_15_7" data-osis="Matt.15.7"><span class="verse-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> Hypocrites! It was well said by Isaiah when he prophesied about you &mdash; </span></span>
<span class="verse Matt_15_8" data-osis="Matt.15.8"><span class="verse-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> &lsquo;This is a people that honour me with their lips, While their hearts are far removed from me;</span></span>
<span class="verse Matt_15_9" data-osis="Matt.15.9"><span class="verse-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> but vainly do they worship me, For they teach but the precepts of men.&rsquo;&rdquo; </span></span>
<span class="verse Matt_15_10" data-osis="Matt.15.10"><span class="verse-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span>Then Jesus called the people to him, and said: <span class="woc"> &ldquo;Listen, and mark my words.</span></span>
<span class="verse Matt_15_11" data-osis="Matt.15.11"><span class="verse-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> It is not what enters a man&rsquo;s mouth that &lsquo;defiles&rsquo; him, but what comes out from his mouth &mdash; that does defile him!&rdquo; </span></span>
<span class="verse Matt_15_12" data-osis="Matt.15.12"><span class="verse-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span>On this his disciples came up to him, and said: &ldquo;Do you know that the Pharisees were shocked on hearing what you said?&rdquo;</span>
<span class="verse Matt_15_13" data-osis="Matt.15.13"><span class="verse-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> &ldquo;Every plant,&rdquo; </span>  Jesus replied, <span class="woc"> &ldquo;that my heavenly Father has not planted will be rooted up.</span></span>
<span class="verse Matt_15_14" data-osis="Matt.15.14"><span class="verse-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> Let them be; they are but blind guides; and, if one blind man guides another, both of them will fall into a ditch.&rdquo; </span></span>
<span class="verse Matt_15_15" data-osis="Matt.15.15"><span class="verse-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span>Upon this, Peter said to Jesus: &ldquo;Explain this saying to us.&rdquo;</span>
<span class="verse Matt_15_16" data-osis="Matt.15.16"><span class="verse-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> &ldquo;What, do even you understand nothing yet?&rdquo; </span>  Jesus exclaimed.</span>
<span class="verse Matt_15_17" data-osis="Matt.15.17"><span class="verse-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> &ldquo;Do not you see that whatever goes into the mouth passes into the stomach, and is afterwards expelled?</span></span>
<span class="verse Matt_15_18" data-osis="Matt.15.18"><span class="verse-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> But the things that come out from the mouth proceed from the heart, and it is these that defile a man;</span></span>
<span class="verse Matt_15_19" data-osis="Matt.15.19"><span class="verse-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> for out of the heart proceed evil thoughts &mdash; murder, adultery, unchastity, theft, perjury, slander.</span></span>
<span class="verse Matt_15_20" data-osis="Matt.15.20"><span class="verse-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> These are the things that defile a man; but eating with unwashed hands does not defile a man.&rdquo; </span></span>

<p>
<span class="verse Matt_15_21" data-osis="Matt.15.21"><span class="verse-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span>On going away from that place, Jesus retired to the country round Tyre and Sidon.</span>
<span class="verse Matt_15_22" data-osis="Matt.15.22"><span class="verse-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span>There, a Canaanite woman of that district came out and began calling to Jesus: &ldquo;Take pity on me, Master, Son of David; my daughter is grievously possessed by a demon.&rdquo;</span>
<span class="verse Matt_15_23" data-osis="Matt.15.23"><span class="verse-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span>But Jesus did not answer her a word; and his disciples came up and begged him to send her away. &ldquo;She keeps calling out after us,&rdquo; they said.</span>
<span class="verse Matt_15_24" data-osis="Matt.15.24"><span class="verse-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> &ldquo;I was not sent,&rdquo; </span>  replied Jesus, <span class="woc"> &ldquo;to any one except the lost sheep of Israel.&rdquo; </span></span>
<span class="verse Matt_15_25" data-osis="Matt.15.25"><span class="verse-num v-25">25&nbsp;</span>But the woman came, and, bowing to the ground before him, said: &ldquo;Master, help me.&rdquo;</span>
<span class="verse Matt_15_26" data-osis="Matt.15.26"><span class="verse-num v-26">26&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> &ldquo;It is not fair,&rdquo; </span>  replied Jesus, <span class="woc"> &ldquo;to take the children&rsquo;s food and throw it to dogs.&rdquo; </span></span>
<span class="verse Matt_15_27" data-osis="Matt.15.27"><span class="verse-num v-27">27&nbsp;</span>&ldquo;Yes, Master,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;for even dogs do feed on the scraps that fall from their owners&rsquo; table.&rdquo;</span>
<span class="verse Matt_15_28" data-osis="Matt.15.28"><span class="verse-num v-28">28&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> &ldquo;Your faith is great,&rdquo; </span>  was his reply to the woman; <span class="woc"> &ldquo;it shall be as you wish!&rdquo; </span>  And her daughter was cured that very hour.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Matt_15_29" data-osis="Matt.15.29"><span class="verse-num v-29">29&nbsp;</span>On leaving that place, Jesus went to the shore of the Sea of Galilee; and then went up the hill, and sat down., you will do what not only what has been done to the fig tree, but, even if you should say to this hill &lsquo;Be lifted up and hurled into the sea!&rsquo; it would be done.</span>
<span class="verse Matt_15_30" data-osis="Matt.15.30"><span class="verse-num v-30">30&nbsp;</span>Great crowds of people came to him, bringing with them those who were lame, crippled, blind, or dumb, and many others. They put them down at his feet, and he cured them;</span>
<span class="verse Matt_15_31" data-osis="Matt.15.31"><span class="verse-num v-31">31&nbsp;</span>and the crowds were astonished, when they saw the dumb talking, the cripples made sound, the lame walking about, and the blind with their sight restored; and they praised the God of Israel.</span>
<span class="verse Matt_15_32" data-osis="Matt.15.32"><span class="verse-num v-32">32&nbsp;</span>Afterwards Jesus called his disciples to him, and said: <span class="woc"> &ldquo;My heart is moved at the sight of all these people, for they have already been with me three days and they have nothing to eat; and I am unwilling to send them away hungry, for fear that they should break down on the way.&rdquo; </span></span>
<span class="verse Matt_15_33" data-osis="Matt.15.33"><span class="verse-num v-33">33&nbsp;</span>&ldquo;Where can we,&rdquo; his disciples asked, &ldquo;in a lonely place find enough bread for such a crowd as this?&rdquo;</span>
<span class="verse Matt_15_34" data-osis="Matt.15.34"><span class="verse-num v-34">34&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> &ldquo;How many loaves have you?&rdquo; </span>  said Jesus. &ldquo;Seven,&rdquo; they answered, &ldquo;and a few small fish.&rdquo;</span>
<span class="verse Matt_15_35" data-osis="Matt.15.35"><span class="verse-num v-35">35&nbsp;</span>Telling the crowd to sit down on the ground,</span>
<span class="verse Matt_15_36" data-osis="Matt.15.36"><span class="verse-num v-36">36&nbsp;</span>Jesus took the seven loaves and the fish, and, after saying the thanksgiving, broke them, and gave them to the disciples; and the disciples gave them to the crowds.</span>
<span class="verse Matt_15_37" data-osis="Matt.15.37"><span class="verse-num v-37">37&nbsp;</span>Every one had sufficient to eat, and they picked up seven baskets full of the broken pieces left.</span>
<span class="verse Matt_15_38" data-osis="Matt.15.38"><span class="verse-num v-38">38&nbsp;</span>The men who ate were four thousand in number without counting women and children.</span>
<span class="verse Matt_15_39" data-osis="Matt.15.39"><span class="verse-num v-39">39&nbsp;</span>Then, after dismissing the crowds, Jesus got into the boat, and went to the neighbourhood of Magadan.</span>
