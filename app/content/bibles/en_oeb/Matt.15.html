<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.15.1"><span class="verse-num verse-1">1&nbsp;</span>Then some Pharisees and Teachers of the Law came to Jesus, and said:</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.15.2"><span class="verse-num">2&nbsp;</span>&ldquo;How is it that your disciples break the traditions of our ancestors? For they do not wash their hands when they eat food.&rdquo;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.15.3"><span class="verse-num">3&nbsp;</span>His reply was: <span class="woc"> &ldquo;How is it that you on your side break God&rsquo;s commandments out of respect for your own traditions?</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.15.4"><span class="verse-num">4&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> For God said &mdash; &lsquo;Honour thy father and mother,&rsquo; and &lsquo;Let him who reviles his father or mother suffer death,&rsquo;</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.15.5"><span class="verse-num">5&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> but you say &lsquo;Whenever any one says to his father or mother &ldquo;Whatever of mine might have been of service to you is &lsquo;Given to God,&rsquo;&rdquo; </span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.15.6"><span class="verse-num">6&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> he is in no way bound to honour his father.&rsquo; In this way you have nullified the words of God on account of your traditions.</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.15.7"><span class="verse-num">7&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> Hypocrites! It was well said by Isaiah when he prophesied about you &mdash; </span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.15.8"><span class="verse-num">8&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> &lsquo;This is a people that honour me with their lips, While their hearts are far removed from me;</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.15.9"><span class="verse-num">9&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> but vainly do they worship me, For they teach but the precepts of men.&rsquo;&rdquo; </span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.15.10"><span class="verse-num">10&nbsp;</span>Then Jesus called the people to him, and said: <span class="woc"> &ldquo;Listen, and mark my words.</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.15.11"><span class="verse-num">11&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> It is not what enters a man&rsquo;s mouth that &lsquo;defiles&rsquo; him, but what comes out from his mouth &mdash; that does defile him!&rdquo; </span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.15.12"><span class="verse-num">12&nbsp;</span>On this his disciples came up to him, and said: &ldquo;Do you know that the Pharisees were shocked on hearing what you said?&rdquo;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.15.13"><span class="verse-num">13&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> &ldquo;Every plant,&rdquo; </span>  Jesus replied, <span class="woc"> &ldquo;that my heavenly Father has not planted will be rooted up.</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.15.14"><span class="verse-num">14&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> Let them be; they are but blind guides; and, if one blind man guides another, both of them will fall into a ditch.&rdquo; </span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.15.15"><span class="verse-num">15&nbsp;</span>Upon this, Peter said to Jesus: &ldquo;Explain this saying to us.&rdquo;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.15.16"><span class="verse-num">16&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> &ldquo;What, do even you understand nothing yet?&rdquo; </span>  Jesus exclaimed.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.15.17"><span class="verse-num">17&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> &ldquo;Do not you see that whatever goes into the mouth passes into the stomach, and is afterwards expelled?</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.15.18"><span class="verse-num">18&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> But the things that come out from the mouth proceed from the heart, and it is these that defile a man;</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.15.19"><span class="verse-num">19&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> for out of the heart proceed evil thoughts &mdash; murder, adultery, unchastity, theft, perjury, slander.</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.15.20"><span class="verse-num">20&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> These are the things that defile a man; but eating with unwashed hands does not defile a man.&rdquo; </span></span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.15.21"><span class="verse-num">21&nbsp;</span>On going away from that place, Jesus retired to the country round Tyre and Sidon.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.15.22"><span class="verse-num">22&nbsp;</span>There, a Canaanite woman of that district came out and began calling to Jesus: &ldquo;Take pity on me, Master, Son of David; my daughter is grievously possessed by a demon.&rdquo;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.15.23"><span class="verse-num">23&nbsp;</span>But Jesus did not answer her a word; and his disciples came up and begged him to send her away. &ldquo;She keeps calling out after us,&rdquo; they said.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.15.24"><span class="verse-num">24&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> &ldquo;I was not sent,&rdquo; </span>  replied Jesus, <span class="woc"> &ldquo;to any one except the lost sheep of Israel.&rdquo; </span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.15.25"><span class="verse-num">25&nbsp;</span>But the woman came, and, bowing to the ground before him, said: &ldquo;Master, help me.&rdquo;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.15.26"><span class="verse-num">26&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> &ldquo;It is not fair,&rdquo; </span>  replied Jesus, <span class="woc"> &ldquo;to take the children&rsquo;s food and throw it to dogs.&rdquo; </span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.15.27"><span class="verse-num">27&nbsp;</span>&ldquo;Yes, Master,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;for even dogs do feed on the scraps that fall from their owners&rsquo; table.&rdquo;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.15.28"><span class="verse-num">28&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> &ldquo;Your faith is great,&rdquo; </span>  was his reply to the woman; <span class="woc"> &ldquo;it shall be as you wish!&rdquo; </span>  And her daughter was cured that very hour.</span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.15.29"><span class="verse-num">29&nbsp;</span>On leaving that place, Jesus went to the shore of the Sea of Galilee; and then went up the hill, and sat down., you will do what not only what has been done to the fig tree, but, even if you should say to this hill &lsquo;Be lifted up and hurled into the sea!&rsquo; it would be done.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.15.30"><span class="verse-num">30&nbsp;</span>Great crowds of people came to him, bringing with them those who were lame, crippled, blind, or dumb, and many others. They put them down at his feet, and he cured them;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.15.31"><span class="verse-num">31&nbsp;</span>and the crowds were astonished, when they saw the dumb talking, the cripples made sound, the lame walking about, and the blind with their sight restored; and they praised the God of Israel.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.15.32"><span class="verse-num">32&nbsp;</span>Afterwards Jesus called his disciples to him, and said: <span class="woc"> &ldquo;My heart is moved at the sight of all these people, for they have already been with me three days and they have nothing to eat; and I am unwilling to send them away hungry, for fear that they should break down on the way.&rdquo; </span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.15.33"><span class="verse-num">33&nbsp;</span>&ldquo;Where can we,&rdquo; his disciples asked, &ldquo;in a lonely place find enough bread for such a crowd as this?&rdquo;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.15.34"><span class="verse-num">34&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> &ldquo;How many loaves have you?&rdquo; </span>  said Jesus. &ldquo;Seven,&rdquo; they answered, &ldquo;and a few small fish.&rdquo;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.15.35"><span class="verse-num">35&nbsp;</span>Telling the crowd to sit down on the ground,</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.15.36"><span class="verse-num">36&nbsp;</span>Jesus took the seven loaves and the fish, and, after saying the thanksgiving, broke them, and gave them to the disciples; and the disciples gave them to the crowds.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.15.37"><span class="verse-num">37&nbsp;</span>Every one had sufficient to eat, and they picked up seven baskets full of the broken pieces left.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.15.38"><span class="verse-num">38&nbsp;</span>The men who ate were four thousand in number without counting women and children.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.15.39"><span class="verse-num">39&nbsp;</span>Then, after dismissing the crowds, Jesus got into the boat, and went to the neighbourhood of Magadan.</span>
