<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.5.1"><span class="verse-num verse-1">1&nbsp;</span>On seeing the crowds of People, Jesus went up the hill; and, when he had taken his seat, his disciples came up to him;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.5.2"><span class="verse-num">2&nbsp;</span>and he began to teach them as follows:</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.5.3"><span class="verse-num">3&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> &ldquo;Blessed are the poor in spirit, </span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.5.4"><span class="verse-num">4&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> Blessed are the mourners, </span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.5.5"><span class="verse-num">5&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> Blessed are the gentle, </span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.5.6"><span class="verse-num">6&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> Blessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness, </span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.5.7"><span class="verse-num">7&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> Blessed are the merciful, </span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.5.8"><span class="verse-num">8&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> Blessed are the pure in heart, </span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.5.9"><span class="verse-num">9&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> Blessed are the peacemakers, </span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.5.10"><span class="verse-num">10&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> Blessed are those who have been persecuted in the cause of righteousness, </span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.5.11"><span class="verse-num">11&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> Blessed are you when people taunt you, and persecute you, and say everything evil about you &mdash; untruly, and on my account.</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.5.12"><span class="verse-num">12&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> Be glad and rejoice, because your reward in Heaven will be great; for so men persecuted the Prophets who lived before you.</span></span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.5.13"><span class="verse-num">13&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> It is you who are the Salt of the earth; but, if the salt should lose its strength, what will you use to restore its saltiness? It is no longer good for anything, but is thrown away, and trampled underfoot.</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.5.14"><span class="verse-num">14&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> It is you who are the Light of the world. A town that stands on a hill cannot be hidden.</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.5.15"><span class="verse-num">15&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> Men do not light a lamp and put it under the corn-measure, but on the lamp-stand, where it gives light to every one in the house.</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.5.16"><span class="verse-num">16&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> Let your light so shine before the eyes of your fellow men, that, seeing your good actions, they may praise your Father who is in Heaven.</span></span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.5.17"><span class="verse-num">17&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> Do not think that I have come to do away with the Law or the Prophets; I have not come to do away with them, but to complete them.</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.5.18"><span class="verse-num">18&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> For I tell you, until the heavens and the earth disappear, not even the smallest letter, nor one stroke of a letter, shall disappear from the Law until all is done.</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.5.19"><span class="verse-num">19&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> Whoever, therefore, breaks one of these commandments, even the least of them, and teaches others to do so, will be the least- esteemed in the Kingdom of Heaven; but whoever keeps them, and teaches others to do so, will be esteemed great in the Kingdom of Heaven.</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.5.20"><span class="verse-num">20&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> Indeed I tell you that, unless your religion is above that of the Teachers of the Law, and Pharisees, you will never enter the Kingdom of Heaven.</span></span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.5.21"><span class="verse-num">21&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> You have heard that to our ancestors it was said &mdash; &lsquo;Thou shalt not commit murder,&rsquo; and &lsquo;Whoever commits murder shall be liable to answer for it to the Court.&rsquo;</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.5.22"><span class="verse-num">22&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> I, however, say to you that any one who cherishes anger against his brother shall be liable to answer for it to the Court; and whoever pours contempt upon his brother shall be liable to answer for it to the High Council, while whoever calls down curses upon him shall be liable to answer for it in the fiery Pit.</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.5.23"><span class="verse-num">23&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> Therefore, when presenting your gift at the altar, if even there you remember that your brother has some grievance against you,</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.5.24"><span class="verse-num">24&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> leave your gift there, before the altar, go and be reconciled to your brother, first, then come and present your gift.</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.5.25"><span class="verse-num">25&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> Be ready to make friends with your opponent, even when you meet him on your way to the court; for fear that he should hand you over to the judge, and the judge to his officer, and you should be thrown into prison.</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.5.26"><span class="verse-num">26&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> I tell you, you will not come out until you have paid the last penny.</span></span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.5.27"><span class="verse-num">27&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> You have heard that it was said &mdash; &lsquo;Thou shalt not commit adultery.&rsquo;</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.5.28"><span class="verse-num">28&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> I, however, say to you that any one who looks at a woman with an impure intention has already committed adultery with her in his heart.</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.5.29"><span class="verse-num">29&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> If your right eye is a snare to you, take it out and throw it away. It would be best for you to lose one part of your body, and not to have the whole of it thrown into the Pit.</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.5.30"><span class="verse-num">30&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> And, if your right hand is a snare to you, cut it off and throw it away. It would be best for you to lose one part of your body, and not to have the whole of it go down to the Pit.</span></span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.5.31"><span class="verse-num">31&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> It was also said &mdash; &lsquo;Let any one who divorces his wife serve her with a notice of separation.&rsquo;</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.5.32"><span class="verse-num">32&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> I, however, say to you that any one who divorces his wife, except on the ground of her unchastity, leads to her committing adultery; while any one who marries her after her divorce is guilty of adultery.</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.5.33"><span class="verse-num">33&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> Again, you have heard that to our ancestors it was said &mdash; &lsquo;Thou shalt not break an oath, but thou shall keep thine oaths as a debt due to the Lord.&rsquo;</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.5.34"><span class="verse-num">34&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> I, however, say to you that you must not swear at all, either by Heaven, since that is God&rsquo;s throne,</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.5.35"><span class="verse-num">35&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> or by the earth, since that is his footstool, or by Jerusalem, since that is the city of the Great King.</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.5.36"><span class="verse-num">36&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> Nor should you swear by your head, since you cannot make a single hair either white or black.</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.5.37"><span class="verse-num">37&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> Let your words be simply &lsquo;Yes&rsquo; or &lsquo;No&rsquo;; anything beyond this comes from what is wrong.</span></span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.5.38"><span class="verse-num">38&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> You have heard that it was said &mdash; &lsquo;An eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth.&rsquo;</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.5.39"><span class="verse-num">39&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> I, however, say to you that you must not resist wrong; but, if any one strikes you on the right cheek, turn the other to him also;</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.5.40"><span class="verse-num">40&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> and, when any one wants to go to law with you, to take your coat, let him have your cloak as well;</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.5.41"><span class="verse-num">41&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> and, if any one compels you to go one mile, go two miles with him.</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.5.42"><span class="verse-num">42&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> Give to him who asks of you; and, from him who wants to borrow from you, do not turn away.</span></span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.5.43"><span class="verse-num">43&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> You have heard that it was said &mdash; &lsquo;Thou shalt love thy neighbour and hate thy enemy.&rsquo;</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.5.44"><span class="verse-num">44&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> I, however, say to you &mdash; Love your enemies, and pray for those who persecute you,</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.5.45"><span class="verse-num">45&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> that you may become Sons of your Father who is in Heaven; for he causes his sun to rise upon bad and good alike, and sends rain upon the righteous and upon the unrighteous.</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.5.46"><span class="verse-num">46&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> For, if you love only those who love you, what reward will you have? Even the tax-gatherers do this!</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.5.47"><span class="verse-num">47&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> And, if you show courtesy to your brothers only, what are you doing more than others? Even the Gentiles do this!</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.5.48"><span class="verse-num">48&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> You, then, must become perfect &mdash; as your heavenly Father is perfect.</span></span>
