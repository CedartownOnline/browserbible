<span class="verse" data-osis="John.4.1"><span class="verse-num verse-1">1&nbsp;</span>Now, when the Master heard that the Pharisees had been told that he was making and baptizing more disciples than John</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.4.2"><span class="verse-num">2&nbsp;</span>(Though it was not Jesus himself, but his disciples, who baptized),</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.4.3"><span class="verse-num">3&nbsp;</span>he left Judea, and set out again for Galilee.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.4.4"><span class="verse-num">4&nbsp;</span>He had to pass through Samaria,</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.4.5"><span class="verse-num">5&nbsp;</span>and, on his way, he came to a Samaritan town called Shechem, near the plot of land that Jacob gave to his son Joseph.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.4.6"><span class="verse-num">6&nbsp;</span>Jacob&rsquo;s Spring was there, and Jesus, being tired after his journey, sat down beside the spring, just as he was. It was then about mid-day.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.4.7"><span class="verse-num">7&nbsp;</span>A woman of Samaria came to draw water; and Jesus said to her- -<span class="woc"> &ldquo;Give me some to drink,&rdquo;</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.4.8"><span class="verse-num">8&nbsp;</span>For his disciples had gone into the town to buy food.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.4.9"><span class="verse-num">9&nbsp;</span>&ldquo;How is it,&rdquo; replied the Samaritan woman, &ldquo;that you who are a Jew ask for water from a Samaritan woman like me?&rdquo; (For Jews do not associate with Samaritans).</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.4.10"><span class="verse-num">10&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> &ldquo;If you knew of the gift of God,&rdquo;</span>  replied Jesus, <span class="woc"> &ldquo;and who it is that is saying to you &lsquo;Give me some water,&rsquo; you would have asked him, and he would have given you &lsquo;living water&rsquo;.&rdquo;</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.4.11"><span class="verse-num">11&nbsp;</span>&ldquo;You have no bucket, Sir, and the well is deep,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;where did you get that &lsquo;living water?&rsquo;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.4.12"><span class="verse-num">12&nbsp;</span>Surely you are not greater than our ancestor Jacob who gave us the well, and used to drink from it himself, and his sons, and his cattle!&rdquo;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.4.13"><span class="verse-num">13&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> &ldquo;All who drink of this water,&rdquo;</span>  replied Jesus, <span class="woc"> &ldquo;will be thirsty again;</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.4.14"><span class="verse-num">14&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> but whoever once drinks of the water that I will give him shall never thirst any more; but the water that I will give him shall become a spring welling up within him &mdash; a source of Immortal Life.&rdquo;</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.4.15"><span class="verse-num">15&nbsp;</span>&ldquo;Give me this water, Sir,&rdquo; said the woman, &ldquo;so that I may not be thirsty, nor have to come all the way here to draw water.&rdquo;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.4.16"><span class="verse-num">16&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> &ldquo;Go and call your husband,&rdquo;</span>  said Jesus, <span class="woc"> &ldquo;and then come back.&rdquo;</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.4.17"><span class="verse-num">17&nbsp;</span>&ldquo;I have no husband,&rdquo; answered the woman. <span class="woc"> &ldquo;You are right in saying &lsquo;I have no husband,&rsquo;&rdquo;</span>  replied Jesus,</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.4.18"><span class="verse-num">18&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> &ldquo;For you have had five husbands, and the man with whom you are now living is not your husband; in saying that, you have spoken the truth.&rdquo;</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.4.19"><span class="verse-num">19&nbsp;</span>&ldquo;I see, Sir, that you are a Prophet!&rdquo; exclaimed the woman.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.4.20"><span class="verse-num">20&nbsp;</span>&ldquo;It was on this mountain that our ancestors worshiped; and yet you Jews say that the proper place for worship is in Jerusalem.&rdquo;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.4.21"><span class="verse-num">21&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> &ldquo;Believe me,&rdquo;</span>  replied Jesus, <span class="woc"> &ldquo;a time is coming when it will be neither on this mountain nor in Jerusalem that you will worship the Father.</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.4.22"><span class="verse-num">22&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> You Samaritans do not know what you worship; we know what we worship, for Salvation comes from the Jews.</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.4.23"><span class="verse-num">23&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> But a time is coming, indeed it is already here, when the true worshipers will worship the Father spiritually and truly; for such are the worshipers that the Father desires.</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.4.24"><span class="verse-num">24&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> God is Spirit; and those who worship him must worship spiritually and truly.&rdquo;</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.4.25"><span class="verse-num">25&nbsp;</span>&ldquo;I know,&rdquo; answered the woman, &ldquo;that the Messiah, who is called the Christ, is coming; when once he has come, he will tell us everything.&rdquo;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.4.26"><span class="verse-num">26&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> &ldquo;I am he,&rdquo;</span>  Jesus said to her, <span class="woc"> &ldquo;I who am speaking to you.&rdquo;</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.4.27"><span class="verse-num">27&nbsp;</span>At this moment his disciples came up, and were surprised to find him talking with a woman; but none of them asked &lsquo;What do you want?&rsquo; or &lsquo;Why are you talking with her?&rsquo;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.4.28"><span class="verse-num">28&nbsp;</span>So the woman, leaving her pitcher, went back to the town, and said to the people:</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.4.29"><span class="verse-num">29&nbsp;</span>&ldquo;Come and see someone who has told me everything that I have done. Can he be the Christ?&rdquo;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.4.30"><span class="verse-num">30&nbsp;</span>And the people left the town and went to see Jesus.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.4.31"><span class="verse-num">31&nbsp;</span>Meanwhile the disciples kept saying to him: &ldquo;Take something to eat, Rabbi.&rdquo;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.4.32"><span class="verse-num">32&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> &ldquo;I have food to eat,&rdquo;</span>  he answered, <span class="woc"> &ldquo;of which you know nothing.&rdquo;</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.4.33"><span class="verse-num">33&nbsp;</span>&ldquo;Can any one have brought him anything to eat?&rdquo; the disciples said to one another.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.4.34"><span class="verse-num">34&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> &ldquo;My food,&rdquo;</span>  replied Jesus, <span class="woc"> &ldquo;is to do the will of him who sent me, and to complete his work.</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.4.35"><span class="verse-num">35&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> Do not you say that it still wants four months to harvest? Why, look up, and see how white the fields are for harvest!</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.4.36"><span class="verse-num">36&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> Already the reaper is receiving wages and gathering in sheaves for Immortal Life, so that sower and reaper rejoice together.</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.4.37"><span class="verse-num">37&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> For here the proverb holds good &mdash; &lsquo;One sows, another reaps.&rsquo;</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.4.38"><span class="verse-num">38&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> I have sent you to reap that on which you have spent no labor; others have laboured, and you have entered upon the results of their labor.&rdquo;</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.4.39"><span class="verse-num">39&nbsp;</span>Many from that town came to believe in Jesus &mdash; Samaritans though they were &mdash; on account of the woman&rsquo;s statement &mdash; &lsquo;He has told me everything that I have done.&rsquo;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.4.40"><span class="verse-num">40&nbsp;</span>And, when these Samaritans had come to Jesus, they begged him to stay with them, and he stayed there two days.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.4.41"><span class="verse-num">41&nbsp;</span>But far more came to believe in him on account of what he said himself,</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.4.42"><span class="verse-num">42&nbsp;</span>and they said to the woman: &ldquo;It is no longer because of what you say that we believe in him, for we have heard him ourselves and know that he really is the Saviour of the world.&rdquo;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.4.43"><span class="verse-num">43&nbsp;</span>After these two days Jesus went on to Galilee;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.4.44"><span class="verse-num">44&nbsp;</span>for he himself declared that &lsquo;a Prophet is not honoured in his own country.&rsquo;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.4.45"><span class="verse-num">45&nbsp;</span>When he entered Galilee, the Galileans welcomed him, for they had seen all that he did at Jerusalem during the Festival, at which they also had been present.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.4.46"><span class="verse-num">46&nbsp;</span>So Jesus came again to Cana in Galilee, where he had turned the water into wine. Now there was one of the King&rsquo;s officers whose son was lying ill at Capernaum.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.4.47"><span class="verse-num">47&nbsp;</span>When this man heard that Jesus had returned from Judea to Galilee, he went to him, and begged him to come down and cure his son; for he was at the point of death.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.4.48"><span class="verse-num">48&nbsp;</span>Jesus answered: <span class="woc"> &ldquo;Unless you all see signs and wonders, you will not believe.&rdquo;</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.4.49"><span class="verse-num">49&nbsp;</span>&ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; said the officer, &ldquo;come down before my child dies.&rdquo; And Jesus answered: &ldquo;Go, your son is living.&rdquo;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.4.50"><span class="verse-num">50&nbsp;</span>The man believed what Jesus said to him, and went;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.4.51"><span class="verse-num">51&nbsp;</span>and, while he was on his way down, his servants met him, and told him that his child was living.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.4.52"><span class="verse-num">52&nbsp;</span>So he asked them at what time the boy began to get better. &ldquo;It was yesterday, about one o&rsquo;clock,&rdquo; they said, &ldquo;that the fever left him.&rdquo;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.4.53"><span class="verse-num">53&nbsp;</span>By this the father knew that it was at the very time when Jesus had said to him <span class="woc"> &lsquo;Your son is living&rsquo;</span>  ; and he himself, with all his household, believed in Jesus.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.4.54"><span class="verse-num">54&nbsp;</span>This was the second occasion on which Jesus gave a sign of his mission on coming from Judea to Galilee.</span>
