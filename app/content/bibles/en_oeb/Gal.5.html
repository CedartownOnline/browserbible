<span class="verse" data-osis="Gal.5.1"><span class="verse-num verse-1">1&nbsp;</span>It is for freedom that Christ set us free; stand firm therefore, and do not again be held under the yoke of slavery.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Gal.5.2"><span class="verse-num">2&nbsp;</span>Understand that I, Paul, myself tell you that if you allow yourselves to be circumcised, Christ will avail you nothing.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Gal.5.3"><span class="verse-num">3&nbsp;</span>I again declare to every one who receives circumcision, that he binds himself to obey the whole Law.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Gal.5.4"><span class="verse-num">4&nbsp;</span>You have severed yourselves from Christ &mdash; you who are seeking to be pronounced righteous through Law; you have fallen away from love.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Gal.5.5"><span class="verse-num">5&nbsp;</span>For we, by the help of the Spirit, are eagerly waiting for the fulfilment of our hope &mdash; that we may be pronounced righteous as the result of faith.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Gal.5.6"><span class="verse-num">6&nbsp;</span>If a man is in union with Christ Jesus, neither is circumcision nor the omission of it anything, but faith, working through love, is everything.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Gal.5.7"><span class="verse-num">7&nbsp;</span>You were once making good progress! Who has hindered you from obeying the Truth?</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Gal.5.8"><span class="verse-num">8&nbsp;</span>The persuasion brought to bear on you does not come from him who calls you.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Gal.5.9"><span class="verse-num">9&nbsp;</span>A little leaven leavens all the dough.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Gal.5.10"><span class="verse-num">10&nbsp;</span>I, through my union with the Lord, am persuaded that you will learn to think with me. But the man who is disturbing your minds will have to bear his punishment, whoever he may be.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Gal.5.11"><span class="verse-num">11&nbsp;</span>If I, Brothers, am still proclaiming circumcision, why am I still persecuted? It seems that the Cross has ceased to be an obstacle!</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Gal.5.12"><span class="verse-num">12&nbsp;</span>I could even wish that the people who are unsettling you would go further still and mutilate themselves.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Gal.5.13"><span class="verse-num">13&nbsp;</span>Remember, Brothers, to you the Call came to give you freedom. Only do not make your freedom an opportunity for self-indulgence, but serve one another in a loving spirit.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Gal.5.14"><span class="verse-num">14&nbsp;</span>Indeed, the whole Law has been summed up in this one precept- -&rsquo;Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thou dost thyself.&rsquo;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Gal.5.15"><span class="verse-num">15&nbsp;</span>But, if you are continually wounding and preying upon one another, take care that you are not destroyed by one another.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Gal.5.16"><span class="verse-num">16&nbsp;</span>This is what I have to say &mdash; Let your steps be guided by the Spirit, and then you will never gratify the cravings of your earthly nature.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Gal.5.17"><span class="verse-num">17&nbsp;</span>For these cravings of our earthly nature conflict with the Spirit, and the Spirit with our earthly nature &mdash; they are two contrary principles &mdash; so that you cannot do what you wish.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Gal.5.18"><span class="verse-num">18&nbsp;</span>But, if you follow the guidance of the Spirit, you are not subject to Law.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Gal.5.19"><span class="verse-num">19&nbsp;</span>The sins of our earthly nature are unmistakable. They are sins like these &mdash; unchastity, impurity, indecency,</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Gal.5.20"><span class="verse-num">20&nbsp;</span>idolatry, sorcery, quarrels, strife, jealousy, outbursts of passion, rivalries, dissensions, divisions,</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Gal.5.21"><span class="verse-num">21&nbsp;</span>feelings of envy, drunkenness, revelry, and the like. And I warn you, as I warned you before, that those who indulge in such things will have no place in the Kingdom of God.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Gal.5.22"><span class="verse-num">22&nbsp;</span>But the fruit produced by the Spirit is love, joy, peace, forbearance, kindliness, generosity, trustfulness, gentleness, self-control.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Gal.5.23"><span class="verse-num">23&nbsp;</span>Against such things there is no law!</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Gal.5.24"><span class="verse-num">24&nbsp;</span>And those who belong to Jesus, the Christ, have already crucified their earthly nature, with its passions and its cravings.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Gal.5.25"><span class="verse-num">25&nbsp;</span>Since our Life is due to the Spirit, let us rule our conduct also by the Spirit.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Gal.5.26"><span class="verse-num">26&nbsp;</span>Do not let us grow vain, and provoke or envy one another.</span>
