<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.3.1"><span class="verse-num verse-1">1&nbsp;</span>About that time John the Baptist first appeared, proclaiming in the Wilderness of Judea:</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.3.2"><span class="verse-num">2&nbsp;</span>&ldquo;Repent, for the Kingdom of Heaven is at hand.&rdquo;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.3.3"><span class="verse-num">3&nbsp;</span>This is he who was spoken of in the Prophet Isaiah, where he says &mdash;</span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.3.4"><span class="verse-num">4&nbsp;</span>John wore clothing made of camels&rsquo; hair, with a belt of leather round his waist, and his food was locusts and wild honey.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.3.5"><span class="verse-num">5&nbsp;</span>At that time Jerusalem, and all Judea, as well as the whole district of the Jordan, went out to him</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.3.6"><span class="verse-num">6&nbsp;</span>and were baptized by him in the river Jordan, confessing their sins.</span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.3.7"><span class="verse-num">7&nbsp;</span>When, however, John saw many of the Pharisees and Sadducees coming to receive his baptism, he said to them:</span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.3.8"><span class="verse-num">8&nbsp;</span>Let your life, then, prove your repentance;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.3.9"><span class="verse-num">9&nbsp;</span>and do not think that you can say among yourselves &lsquo;Abraham is our ancestor,&rsquo; for I tell you that out of these very stones God is able to raise descendants for Abraham!</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.3.10"><span class="verse-num">10&nbsp;</span>Already the axe is lying at the root of the trees. Therefore every tree that fails to bear good fruit will be cut down and thrown into the fire.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.3.11"><span class="verse-num">11&nbsp;</span>I, indeed, baptize you with water to teach repentance; but he who is coming after me is more powerful than I, and I am not fit even to carry his sandals. He will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and with fire.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.3.12"><span class="verse-num">12&nbsp;</span>His winnowing-fan is in his hand, and he will clear his threshing-floor, and store his grain in the barn, but the chaff he will burn with inextinguishable fire.&rdquo;</span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.3.13"><span class="verse-num">13&nbsp;</span>Then Jesus came from Galilee to the Jordan, to John, to be baptized by him.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.3.14"><span class="verse-num">14&nbsp;</span>But John tried to prevent him.</span>

</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.3.15"><span class="verse-num">15&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> &ldquo;Let it be so for the present,&rdquo; </span>  Jesus answered, <span class="woc"> &ldquo;since it is fitting for us thus to satisfy every claim of religion.&rdquo; </span>  Upon this, John consented.</span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.3.16"><span class="verse-num">16&nbsp;</span>After the baptism of Jesus, and just as he came up from the water, the heavens opened, and he saw the Spirit of God descending, like a dove, and alighting upon him,</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.3.17"><span class="verse-num">17&nbsp;</span>and from the heavens there came a voice which said: &ldquo;This is my son, the Beloved, in whom I delight.&rdquo;</span>
