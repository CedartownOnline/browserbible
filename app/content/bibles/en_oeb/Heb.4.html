<span class="verse Heb_4_1" data-osis="Heb.4.1"><span class="verse-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span>We must, therefore, be very careful, though there is a promise still standing that we shall enter upon God&rsquo;s Rest, that none of you even appear to have missed it.</span>
<span class="verse Heb_4_2" data-osis="Heb.4.2"><span class="verse-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span>For we have had the Good News told us just as they had. But the Message which they heard did them no good, since they did not share the faith of those who were attentive to it.</span>
<span class="verse Heb_4_3" data-osis="Heb.4.3"><span class="verse-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span>Upon that Rest we who have believed are now entering. As God has said &mdash;  &lsquo;In my wrath I swore &mdash; &ldquo;They shall never enter upon my Rest;&rdquo;&rsquo; Although God&rsquo;s work was finished at the creation of the world;</span>
<span class="verse Heb_4_4" data-osis="Heb.4.4"><span class="verse-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span>for, in a passage referring to the seventh day, you will find these words &mdash;  &lsquo;God rested upon the seventh day after all his work.&rsquo;</span>
<span class="verse Heb_4_5" data-osis="Heb.4.5"><span class="verse-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span>On the other hand, we read in that passage &mdash;  &lsquo; They shall never enter upon my Rest.&rsquo;</span>
<span class="verse Heb_4_6" data-osis="Heb.4.6"><span class="verse-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span>Since, then, there is still a promise that some shall enter upon this Rest, and since those who were first told the Good News did not enter upon it, because of their disbelief,</span>
<span class="verse Heb_4_7" data-osis="Heb.4.7"><span class="verse-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span>again God fixed a day. &lsquo;To-day,&rsquo; he said, speaking after a long interval through the mouth of David, in the passage already quoted &mdash;  &lsquo;If to-day you hear God&rsquo;s voice harden not your hearts.&rsquo;</span>
<span class="verse Heb_4_8" data-osis="Heb.4.8"><span class="verse-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span>Now if Joshua had given &lsquo;Rest&rsquo; to the people, God would not have spoken of another and later day.</span>
<span class="verse Heb_4_9" data-osis="Heb.4.9"><span class="verse-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span>There is, then, a Sabbath-Rest still awaiting God&rsquo;s People.</span>
<span class="verse Heb_4_10" data-osis="Heb.4.10"><span class="verse-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span>For he who enters upon God&rsquo;s Rest does himself rest after his work, just as God did.</span>
<span class="verse Heb_4_11" data-osis="Heb.4.11"><span class="verse-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span>Let us, therefore, make every effort to enter upon that Rest, so that none of us fall through such disbelief as that of which we have had an example.</span>
<span class="verse Heb_4_12" data-osis="Heb.4.12"><span class="verse-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span>God&rsquo;s Message is a living and active power, sharper than any two-edged sword, piercing its way till it penetrates soul and spirit &mdash; not the joints only but the very marrow &mdash; and detecting the inmost thoughts and purposes of the mind.</span>
<span class="verse Heb_4_13" data-osis="Heb.4.13"><span class="verse-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span>There is no created thing that can hide itself from the sight of God. Everything is exposed and laid bare before the eyes of him to whom we have to give account.</span>
<span class="verse Heb_4_14" data-osis="Heb.4.14"><span class="verse-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span>We have, then , in Jesus, the Son of God, a great High Priest who has passed into the highest Heaven; let us, therefore, hold fast to the Faith which we have professed.</span>
<span class="verse Heb_4_15" data-osis="Heb.4.15"><span class="verse-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span>Our High Priest is not one unable to sympathise with our weaknesses, but one who has in every way been tempted, exactly as we have been, but without sinning.</span>
<span class="verse Heb_4_16" data-osis="Heb.4.16"><span class="verse-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span>Therefore, let us draw near boldly to the Throne of Love, to find pity and love for the hour of need.</span>
