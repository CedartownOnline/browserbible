<span class="verse" data-osis="1Cor.13.1"><span class="verse-num verse-1">1&nbsp;</span>Though I speak in the &lsquo;tongues&rsquo; of men, or even of angels, yet have not Love, I have become mere echoing brass, or a clanging cymbal!</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="1Cor.13.2"><span class="verse-num">2&nbsp;</span>Even though I have the gift of preaching, and fathom all hidden truths and all the depths of knowledge; even though I have such faith as might move mountains, yet have not Love, I am nothing!</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="1Cor.13.3"><span class="verse-num">3&nbsp;</span>Even though I dole my substance to the poor, even though I sacrifice my body, that I may boast, yet have not Love, it avails me nothing!</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="1Cor.13.4"><span class="verse-num">4&nbsp;</span>Love is long-suffering, and kind; Love is never envious, never boastful, never conceited, never behaves unbecomingly;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="1Cor.13.5"><span class="verse-num">5&nbsp;</span>love is never self-seeking, never provoked, never reckons up her wrongs;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="1Cor.13.6"><span class="verse-num">6&nbsp;</span>love never rejoices at evil, but rejoices in the triumph of Truth;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="1Cor.13.7"><span class="verse-num">7&nbsp;</span>love bears with all things, every trustful, ever hopeful, ever patient.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="1Cor.13.8"><span class="verse-num">8&nbsp;</span>Love never fails. But, whether it be the gift of preaching, it will be done with; whether it be the gift of &lsquo;tongues,&rsquo; it will cease; whether it be knowledge, it, too, will be done with.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="1Cor.13.9"><span class="verse-num">9&nbsp;</span>For our knowledge is incomplete, and our preaching is incomplete,</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="1Cor.13.10"><span class="verse-num">10&nbsp;</span>but, when the Perfect has come, that which is incomplete will be done with.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="1Cor.13.11"><span class="verse-num">11&nbsp;</span>When I was a child, I talked as a child, I felt as a child, I reasoned as a child; now that I am a man, I have done with childish ways.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="1Cor.13.12"><span class="verse-num">12&nbsp;</span>As yet we see, in a mirror, dimly, but then-face to face! As yet my knowledge is incomplete, but then I shall know in full, as I have been fully known.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="1Cor.13.13"><span class="verse-num">13&nbsp;</span>Meanwhile Faith, Hope, and Love endure-these three, but the greatest of these is Love.</span>
