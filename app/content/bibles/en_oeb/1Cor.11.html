<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="1Cor.11.1"><span class="verse-num verse-1">1&nbsp;</span>Imitate me, as I myself imitate Christ.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="1Cor.11.2"><span class="verse-num">2&nbsp;</span>I praise you, indeed, because you never forget me, and are keeping my injunctions in mind, exactly as I laid them upon you.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="1Cor.11.3"><span class="verse-num">3&nbsp;</span>But I am anxious that you should understand that the Christ is the Head of every man, that man is the Head of woman, and that God is the Head of the Christ.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="1Cor.11.4"><span class="verse-num">4&nbsp;</span>Any man who keeps his head covered, when praying or preaching in public, dishonours him who is his Head;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="1Cor.11.5"><span class="verse-num">5&nbsp;</span>while any woman, who prays or preaches in public bare-headed, dishonours him who is her Head; for that is to make herself like one of the shameless women who shave their heads.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="1Cor.11.6"><span class="verse-num">6&nbsp;</span>Indeed, if a woman does not keep her head covered, she may as well cut her hair short. But, since to cut her hair short, or shave it off, marks her as one of the shameless women, let her keep her head covered.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="1Cor.11.7"><span class="verse-num">7&nbsp;</span>A man ought not to have his head covered, for he has been from the beginning &lsquo;the likeness of God&rsquo; and the reflection of his glory, but woman is the reflection of man&rsquo;s glory.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="1Cor.11.8"><span class="verse-num">8&nbsp;</span>For it was not man who was taken from woman, but woman who was taken from man.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="1Cor.11.9"><span class="verse-num">9&nbsp;</span>Besides, man was not created for the sake of woman, but woman for the sake of man.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="1Cor.11.10"><span class="verse-num">10&nbsp;</span>And, therefore, a woman ought to wear on her head a symbol of her subjection, because of the presence of the angels.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="1Cor.11.11"><span class="verse-num">11&nbsp;</span>Still, when in union with the Lord, woman is not independent of man, or man of woman;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="1Cor.11.12"><span class="verse-num">12&nbsp;</span>for just as woman came from man, so man comes by means of woman; and all things come from God.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="1Cor.11.13"><span class="verse-num">13&nbsp;</span>Judge for yourselves. Is it fitting that a woman should pray to God in public with her head uncovered?</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="1Cor.11.14"><span class="verse-num">14&nbsp;</span>Does not nature herself teach us that, while for a man to wear his hair long is degrading to him,</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="1Cor.11.15"><span class="verse-num">15&nbsp;</span>a woman&rsquo;s long hair is her glory? Her hair has been given her to serve as a covering.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="1Cor.11.16"><span class="verse-num">16&nbsp;</span>If, however, any one still thinks it right to contest the point-well, we have no such custom, nor have the Churches of God.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="1Cor.11.17"><span class="verse-num">17&nbsp;</span>In giving directions on the next subject, I cannot praise you; because your meetings do more harm than good.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="1Cor.11.18"><span class="verse-num">18&nbsp;</span>To begin with, I hear you and, to some extent, I believe it.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="1Cor.11.19"><span class="verse-num">19&nbsp;</span>Indeed, there must be actual parties among you, for so only will the men of real worth become known.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="1Cor.11.20"><span class="verse-num">20&nbsp;</span>When you meet together, as I understand, it is not possible to eat the Lord&rsquo;s Supper;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="1Cor.11.21"><span class="verse-num">21&nbsp;</span>for, as you eat, each of you tries to secure his own supper first, with the result that one has too little to eat, and another has too much to drink!</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="1Cor.11.22"><span class="verse-num">22&nbsp;</span>Have you no houses in which you can eat and drink? Or are you trying to show your contempt for the Church of God, and to humiliate the poor? What can I say to you? Shall I praise you? In this matter I cannot praise you.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="1Cor.11.23"><span class="verse-num">23&nbsp;</span>For I myself received from the Lord the account which I have in turn given to you-how the Lord Jesus, on the very night of his betrayal, took some bread,</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="1Cor.11.24"><span class="verse-num">24&nbsp;</span>and, after saying the thanksgiving, broke it and said <span class="woc"> &ldquo;This is my own body given on your behalf. Do this in memory of me.&rdquo;</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="1Cor.11.25"><span class="verse-num">25&nbsp;</span>And in the same way with the cup, after supper, saying <span class="woc"> &ldquo;This cup is the new Covenant made by my blood. Do this, whenever you drink it, in memory of me.&rdquo;</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="1Cor.11.26"><span class="verse-num">26&nbsp;</span>For whenever you eat this bread and drink the cup, you proclaim the Lord&rsquo;s death-till he comes.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="1Cor.11.27"><span class="verse-num">27&nbsp;</span>Therefore, whoever eats the bread, or drinks the Lord&rsquo;s cup, in an irreverent spirit, will have to answer for an offence against the Lord&rsquo;s body and blood.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="1Cor.11.28"><span class="verse-num">28&nbsp;</span>Let each man look into his own heart, and only then eat of the bread and drink from the cup.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="1Cor.11.29"><span class="verse-num">29&nbsp;</span>For the man who eats and drinks brings a judgment upon himself by his eating and drinking, when he does not discern the body.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="1Cor.11.30"><span class="verse-num">30&nbsp;</span>That is why so many among you are weak and ill, and why some are sleeping.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="1Cor.11.31"><span class="verse-num">31&nbsp;</span>But, if we judged ourselves rightly, we should not be judged.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="1Cor.11.32"><span class="verse-num">32&nbsp;</span>Yet, in being judged by the Lord, we are undergoing discipline, so that we may not have judgment passed upon us with the rest of the world.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="1Cor.11.33"><span class="verse-num">33&nbsp;</span>Therefore, my Brothers, when you meet together to eat the Supper, wait for one another.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="1Cor.11.34"><span class="verse-num">34&nbsp;</span>If a man is hungry, let him eat at home, so that your meetings may not bring a judgment upon you. The other details I will settle when I come.</span>
