<span class="verse" data-osis="Mark.16.1"><span class="verse-num verse-1">1&nbsp;</span>When the Sabbath was over, Mary of Magdala, Mary the mother of James, and Salome bought some spices, so that they might go and anoint the body of Jesus.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Mark.16.2"><span class="verse-num">2&nbsp;</span>And very early on the first day of the week they went to the tomb, after sunrise.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Mark.16.3"><span class="verse-num">3&nbsp;</span>They were saying to one another: &ldquo;Who will roll away the stone for us from the entrance of the tomb?&rdquo;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Mark.16.4"><span class="verse-num">4&nbsp;</span>But, on looking up, they saw that the stone had already been rolled back; it was a very large one.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Mark.16.5"><span class="verse-num">5&nbsp;</span>Going into the tomb, they saw a young man sitting on their right, in a white robe, and they were dismayed; But he said to them:</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Mark.16.6"><span class="verse-num">6&nbsp;</span>&ldquo;Do not be dismayed; you are looking for Jesus, the Nazarene, who has been crucified; he has risen, he is not here! Look! Here is the place where they laid him.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Mark.16.7"><span class="verse-num">7&nbsp;</span>But go, and say to his disciples and to Peter &lsquo;He is going before you into Galilee; there you will see him, as he told you.&rsquo;&rdquo;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Mark.16.8"><span class="verse-num">8&nbsp;</span>They went out, and fled from the tomb, for they were trembling and bewildered; and they did not say a word to any one, for they were frightened;</span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="Mark.16.9"><span class="verse-num">9&nbsp;</span>after his rising again, early on the first day of the week, Jesus appeared first of all to Mary of Magdala, from whom he had driven out seven demons.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Mark.16.10"><span class="verse-num">10&nbsp;</span>She went and told the news to those who had been with him and who were now in sorrow and tears;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Mark.16.11"><span class="verse-num">11&nbsp;</span>yet even they, when they heard that he was alive and had been seen by her, did not believe it.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Mark.16.12"><span class="verse-num">12&nbsp;</span>Afterwards, altered in appearance, he made himself known to two of them, as they were walking, on their way into the country.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Mark.16.13"><span class="verse-num">13&nbsp;</span>They also went and told the rest, but they did not believe even them.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Mark.16.14"><span class="verse-num">14&nbsp;</span>Later on, he made himself known to the Eleven themselves as they were at a meal, and reproached them with their want of faith and their stubbornness, because they did not believe those who had seen him after he had risen from the dead.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Mark.16.15"><span class="verse-num">15&nbsp;</span>Then he said to them: <span class="woc"> &ldquo;Go into all the world, and proclaim the Good News to all creation.</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Mark.16.16"><span class="verse-num">16&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> He who believes and is baptized shall be saved; but he who refuses to believe will be condemned.</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Mark.16.17"><span class="verse-num">17&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> Moreover these signs shall attend those who believe. In my Name they shall drive out demons; they shall speak with &lsquo;tongues&rsquo;;</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Mark.16.18"><span class="verse-num">18&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> they shall take up serpents in their hands; and, if they drink any poison, it shall not hurt them; they will place their hands on sick people and they shall recover.&rdquo;</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Mark.16.19"><span class="verse-num">19&nbsp;</span>So the Lord Jesus, after he had spoken to them, was taken up into Heaven, and sat at the right hand of God.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Mark.16.20"><span class="verse-num">20&nbsp;</span>But they set out, and made the proclamation everywhere, the Lord working with them, and confirming the Message by the signs which attended it.</span>
