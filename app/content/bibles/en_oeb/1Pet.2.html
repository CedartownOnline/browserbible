<span class="verse" data-osis="1Pet.2.1"><span class="verse-num verse-1">1&nbsp;</span>Now that you have done with all malice, all deceitfulness, insincerity, jealous feelings, and all back-biting,</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="1Pet.2.2"><span class="verse-num">2&nbsp;</span>like newly born infants, crave pure spiritual milk, so that you may be enabled by it to grow till you attain Salvation &mdash;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="1Pet.2.3"><span class="verse-num">3&nbsp;</span>since &lsquo;you have found by experience that the Lord is kind.&rsquo;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="1Pet.2.4"><span class="verse-num">4&nbsp;</span>Come to Him, then, as to a living stone, rejected, indeed, by men, but in God&rsquo;s eyes choice and precious;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="1Pet.2.5"><span class="verse-num">5&nbsp;</span>and, as living stones, form yourselves into a spiritual House, to be a consecrated Priesthood, for the offering of spiritual sacrifices that will be acceptable to God through Jesus Christ.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="1Pet.2.6"><span class="verse-num">6&nbsp;</span>For there is a passage of Scripture that runs &mdash;  &lsquo;See, I am placing in Zion a choice and precious corner-stone; And he who believes in him shall have no cause for shame.&rsquo;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="1Pet.2.7"><span class="verse-num">7&nbsp;</span>It is to you, then, who believe in him that he is precious, but to those who do not believe he is &lsquo;a stone which, though rejected by the builders, has now itself become the corner-stone,&rsquo;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="1Pet.2.8"><span class="verse-num">8&nbsp;</span>and &lsquo;a stumbling-block, and a rock which shall prove a hindrance.&rsquo; They stumble because they do not accept the Message. This was the fate destined for them.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="1Pet.2.9"><span class="verse-num">9&nbsp;</span>But you are &lsquo;a chosen race, a royal priesthood, a consecrated nation, God&rsquo;s own People,&rsquo; entrusted with the proclamation of the goodness of him who called you out of Darkness into his wonderful Light.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="1Pet.2.10"><span class="verse-num">10&nbsp;</span>Once you were &lsquo;not a people,&rsquo; but now you are &lsquo;God&rsquo;s People&rsquo;; once you &lsquo;had not found mercy,&rsquo; but now you &lsquo;have found mercy.&rsquo;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="1Pet.2.11"><span class="verse-num">11&nbsp;</span>Dear friends, I urge you, as pilgrims and strangers upon earth, to refrain from indulging the cravings of your earthly nature, for they make war upon the soul.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="1Pet.2.12"><span class="verse-num">12&nbsp;</span>Let your daily life among the Gentiles be so upright, that, whenever they malign you as evil-doers, they may learn, as they watch, from the uprightness of your conduct, to praise God &lsquo;at the time when he shall visit them.&rsquo;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="1Pet.2.13"><span class="verse-num">13&nbsp;</span>Submit to all human institutions for the Lord&rsquo;s sake, alike to the emperor as the supreme authority,</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="1Pet.2.14"><span class="verse-num">14&nbsp;</span>and to governors as the men sent by him to punish evil-doers and to commend those who do right.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="1Pet.2.15"><span class="verse-num">15&nbsp;</span>For God&rsquo;s will is this &mdash; that you should silence the ignorance of foolish people by doing what is right.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="1Pet.2.16"><span class="verse-num">16&nbsp;</span>Act as free men, yet not using your freedom as those do who make it a cloak for wickedness, but as Servants of God.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="1Pet.2.17"><span class="verse-num">17&nbsp;</span>Show honour to every one, Love the Brotherhood, &lsquo;revere God, honour the emperor.&rsquo;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="1Pet.2.18"><span class="verse-num">18&nbsp;</span>Those of you who are domestic servants should always be submissive and respectful to their masters, not only to those who are good and considerate, but also to those who are arbitrary.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="1Pet.2.19"><span class="verse-num">19&nbsp;</span>For this wins God&rsquo;s approval when, because conscious of God&rsquo;s presence, a man who is suffering unjustly bears his troubles patiently.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="1Pet.2.20"><span class="verse-num">20&nbsp;</span>What credit can you claim when, after doing wrong, you take your punishment for it patiently? But, on the other hand, if, after doing right, you take your sufferings patiently, that does win the approval of God.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="1Pet.2.21"><span class="verse-num">21&nbsp;</span>For it was to this that you were called! For Christ, too, suffered &mdash; on your behalf &mdash; and left you an example, that you should follow in his steps.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="1Pet.2.22"><span class="verse-num">22&nbsp;</span>He &lsquo;never sinned, nor was anything deceitful ever heard from his lips.&rsquo;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="1Pet.2.23"><span class="verse-num">23&nbsp;</span>He was abused, but he did not answer with abuse; he suffered, but he did not threaten; he entrusted himself to him whose judgments are just.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="1Pet.2.24"><span class="verse-num">24&nbsp;</span>And he &lsquo;himself carried our sins&rsquo; in his own body to the cross, so that we might die to our sins, and live for righteousness. &lsquo;His bruising was your healing.&rsquo;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="1Pet.2.25"><span class="verse-num">25&nbsp;</span>Once you were straying like sheep, but now you have returned to the Shepherd and Guardian of your souls.</span>
