<h3>Paul’s Second Letter to Timothy</h3>
<h2 class="chapter-num">1</h2>
<p>
<span class="verse 2Tim_1_1" data-osis="2Tim.1.1"><span class="verse-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span>To Timothy, my dear Child, from Paul who, by the will of God, is an Apostle of Christ Jesus, charged to proclaim the Life that comes from union with Christ Jesus. May God , the Father, and Christ Jesus, our Lord, bless you, and be merciful to you, and give you peace.</span>
<span class="verse 2Tim_1_3" data-osis="2Tim.1.3"><span class="verse-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span>I am thankful to God, whom I serve, as my ancestors did, with a clear conscience, when I remember you, as I never fail to do, in my prayers &mdash; night and day alike,</span>
<span class="verse 2Tim_1_4" data-osis="2Tim.1.4"><span class="verse-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span>as I think of your tears, longing to see you, that my happiness may be completed,</span>
<span class="verse 2Tim_1_5" data-osis="2Tim.1.5"><span class="verse-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span>now that I have been reminded of the sincere faith that you have shown. That faith was seen first in your grandmother Lois and your mother Eunice, and is now, I am convinced, in you also.</span>
<span class="verse 2Tim_1_6" data-osis="2Tim.1.6"><span class="verse-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span>And that is my reason for reminding you to stir into flame that gift of God, which is yours through your ordination at my hands.</span>
<span class="verse 2Tim_1_7" data-osis="2Tim.1.7"><span class="verse-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span>For the Spirit which God gave us was not a spirit of cowardice, but a spirit of power, love, and self-control.</span>
<span class="verse 2Tim_1_8" data-osis="2Tim.1.8"><span class="verse-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span>Do not, therefore, be ashamed of the testimony which we have to bear to our Lord, nor yet of me who am a prisoner for him; but join with me in suffering for the Good News, as far as God enables you.</span>
<span class="verse 2Tim_1_9" data-osis="2Tim.1.9"><span class="verse-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span>It was God who saved us, and from him we received our solemn Call &mdash; not as a reward for anything that we had done, but in fulfilment of his own loving purpose. For that love was extended to us, through Christ Jesus, before time began,</span>
<span class="verse 2Tim_1_10" data-osis="2Tim.1.10"><span class="verse-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span>and has now been made apparent through the Appearing of our Saviour, Christ Jesus; who has made an end of Death, and has brought Life and Immortality to light by that Good News,</span>
<span class="verse 2Tim_1_11" data-osis="2Tim.1.11"><span class="verse-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span>of which I was myself appointed a Herald and Apostle, and Teacher.</span>
<span class="verse 2Tim_1_12" data-osis="2Tim.1.12"><span class="verse-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span>That is why I am undergoing these sufferings; yet I feel no shame, for I know in whom I have put my faith, and am convinced that he is able to guard what I have entrusted to him until &lsquo;That Day.&rsquo;</span>
<span class="verse 2Tim_1_13" data-osis="2Tim.1.13"><span class="verse-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span>Keep before you, as an example of sound teaching, all that you learnt from me as you listened with that faith and love which come from union with Christ Jesus.</span>
<span class="verse 2Tim_1_14" data-osis="2Tim.1.14"><span class="verse-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span>Guard by the help of the Holy Spirit, who is within us, the glorious trust that has been committed to you.</span>
<span class="verse 2Tim_1_15" data-osis="2Tim.1.15"><span class="verse-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span>You know, of course, that all our friends in Roman Asia turned their backs on me, and among them Phygellus and Hermogenes.</span>
<span class="verse 2Tim_1_16" data-osis="2Tim.1.16"><span class="verse-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span>May the Lord show mercy to the household of Onesiphorus; for he often cheered me and was not ashamed of my chains.</span>
<span class="verse 2Tim_1_17" data-osis="2Tim.1.17"><span class="verse-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span>On the contrary, when he arrived in Rome, he sought eagerly for me till he found me.</span>
<span class="verse 2Tim_1_18" data-osis="2Tim.1.18"><span class="verse-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span>The Lord grant that he may find mercy at the hands of the Lord on &lsquo;That Day.&rsquo; The many services that he rendered at Ephesus you have the best means of knowing.</span>
