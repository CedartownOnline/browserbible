<span class="verse" data-osis="John.2.1"><span class="verse-num verse-1">1&nbsp;</span>Two days after this there was a wedding at Cana in Galilee, and Jesus&rsquo; mother was there.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.2.2"><span class="verse-num">2&nbsp;</span>Jesus himself, too, with his disciples, was invited to the wedding.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.2.3"><span class="verse-num">3&nbsp;</span>And, when the wine ran short, his mother said to him: &ldquo;They have no wine left.&rdquo;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.2.4"><span class="verse-num">4&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> &ldquo;What do you want with me?&rdquo;</span>  answered Jesus. <span class="woc"> &ldquo;My time has not come yet.&rdquo;</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.2.5"><span class="verse-num">5&nbsp;</span>His mother said to the servants: &ldquo;Do whatever he tells you.&rdquo;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.2.6"><span class="verse-num">6&nbsp;</span>There were standing there six stone water-jars, in accordance with the Jewish rule of &lsquo;purification,&rsquo; each holding twenty or thirty gallons.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.2.7"><span class="verse-num">7&nbsp;</span>Jesus said to the servants: <span class="woc"> &ldquo;Fill the water-jars with water;&rdquo;</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.2.8"><span class="verse-num">8&nbsp;</span>And, when they had filled them to the brim, he added: <span class="woc"> &ldquo;Now take some out, and carry it to the Master of the Feast.&rdquo;</span>  The servants did so.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.2.9"><span class="verse-num">9&nbsp;</span>And, when the Master of the Feast had tasted the water which had now become wine, not knowing where it had come from &mdash; although the servants who had taken out the water knew &mdash;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.2.10"><span class="verse-num">10&nbsp;</span>He called the bridegroom and said to him: &ldquo;Every one puts good wine on the table first, and inferior wine afterwards, when his guests have drunk freely; but you have kept back the good wine till now!&rdquo;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.2.11"><span class="verse-num">11&nbsp;</span>This, the first sign of his mission, Jesus gave at Cana in Galilee, and by it revealed his glory; and his disciples believed in him.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.2.12"><span class="verse-num">12&nbsp;</span>After this, Jesus went down to Capernaum &mdash; he, his mother, his brothers, and his disciples; but they stayed there only a few days.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.2.13"><span class="verse-num">13&nbsp;</span>Then, as the Jewish Passover was near, Jesus went up to Jerusalem.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.2.14"><span class="verse-num">14&nbsp;</span>In the Temple Courts he found people who were selling bullocks, sheep, and pigeons, and the money-changers at their counters.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.2.15"><span class="verse-num">15&nbsp;</span>So he made a whip of cords, and drove them all out of the Temple Courts, and the sheep and bullocks as well; he scattered the money of the money-changers, and overturned their tables,</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.2.16"><span class="verse-num">16&nbsp;</span>and said to the pigeon-dealers: <span class="woc"> &ldquo;Take these things away. Do not turn my Father&rsquo;s House into a market-house.&rdquo;</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.2.17"><span class="verse-num">17&nbsp;</span>His disciples remembered that Scripture said &mdash; &lsquo;Zeal for thy House will consume me.&rsquo;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.2.18"><span class="verse-num">18&nbsp;</span>Upon this the Jews asked Jesus: &ldquo;What sign are you going to show us, since you act in this way?&rdquo;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.2.19"><span class="verse-num">19&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> &ldquo;Destroy this temple,&rdquo;</span>  was his answer, <span class="woc"> &ldquo;and I will raise it in three days.&rdquo;</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.2.20"><span class="verse-num">20&nbsp;</span>&ldquo;This Temple,&rdquo; replied the Jews, &ldquo;has been forty-six years in building, and are you going to &lsquo;raise it in three days&rsquo;?&rdquo;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.2.21"><span class="verse-num">21&nbsp;</span>But Jesus was speaking of his body as a temple.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.2.22"><span class="verse-num">22&nbsp;</span>Afterwards, when he had risen from the dead, his disciples remembered that he had said this; and they believed the passage of Scripture, and the words which Jesus had spoken.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.2.23"><span class="verse-num">23&nbsp;</span>While Jesus was in Jerusalem, during the Passover Festival, many came to trust in him, when they saw the signs of his mission that he was giving.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.2.24"><span class="verse-num">24&nbsp;</span>But Jesus did not trust himself to them, since he could read every heart,</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.2.25"><span class="verse-num">25&nbsp;</span>and because he did not need that others should tell him what men were; for he could of himself read what was in men.</span>
