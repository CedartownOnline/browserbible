<h3>The Good News According to Mark</h3>
<h2 class="chapter-num">1</h2>
<p>
<span class="verse Mark_1_1" data-osis="Mark.1.1"><span class="verse-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span>The beginning of the Good News about Jesus Christ.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Mark_1_2" data-osis="Mark.1.2"><span class="verse-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span>It is said in the Prophet Isaiah &mdash; &lsquo;Behold! I send my Messenger before thy face; he shall prepare thy way.</span>
<span class="verse Mark_1_3" data-osis="Mark.1.3"><span class="verse-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span>The voice of one crying aloud in the Wilderness: &ldquo;Make ready the way of the Lord, make his paths straight.&rdquo;&rsquo;</span>
<span class="verse Mark_1_4" data-osis="Mark.1.4"><span class="verse-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span>And in fulfilment of this, John the Baptizer appeared in the Wilderness, proclaiming a baptism upon repentance, for the forgiveness of sins.</span>
<span class="verse Mark_1_5" data-osis="Mark.1.5"><span class="verse-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span>The whole of Judea, as well as all the inhabitants of Jerusalem, went out to him; and they were baptized by him in the river Jordan, confessing their sins.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Mark_1_6" data-osis="Mark.1.6"><span class="verse-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span>John was clad in clothing of camels&rsquo; hair, with a belt of leather round his waist, and lived on locusts and wild honey;</span>
<span class="verse Mark_1_7" data-osis="Mark.1.7"><span class="verse-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span>and he proclaimed &mdash; &ldquo;There is coming after me one more powerful than I, and I am not fit even to stoop down and unfasten his sandals.</span>
<span class="verse Mark_1_8" data-osis="Mark.1.8"><span class="verse-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span>I have baptized you with water, but he will baptize you with the Holy Spirit.&rdquo;</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Mark_1_9" data-osis="Mark.1.9"><span class="verse-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span>Now about that time Jesus came from Nazareth in Galilee, and was baptized by John in the Jordan.</span>
<span class="verse Mark_1_10" data-osis="Mark.1.10"><span class="verse-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span>And just as he was coming up out of the water, he saw the heavens rent apart, and the Spirit, like a dove, descending upon him,</span>
<span class="verse Mark_1_11" data-osis="Mark.1.11"><span class="verse-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span>and from the heavens came a voice &mdash; &ldquo;Thou art my Son, the Beloved; in thee I delight.&rdquo;</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Mark_1_12" data-osis="Mark.1.12"><span class="verse-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span>Immediately afterwards the Spirit drove Jesus out into the Wilderness;</span>
<span class="verse Mark_1_13" data-osis="Mark.1.13"><span class="verse-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span>and he was there in the Wilderness forty days, tempted by Satan, and among the wild beasts, while the angels ministered to him.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Mark_1_14" data-osis="Mark.1.14"><span class="verse-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span>After John had been committed to prison, Jesus went to Galilee, proclaiming the Good News of God &mdash;</span>
<span class="verse Mark_1_15" data-osis="Mark.1.15"><span class="verse-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> &ldquo;The time has come, and the Kingdom of God is at hand; repent, and believe the Good News.&rdquo;</span></span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Mark_1_16" data-osis="Mark.1.16"><span class="verse-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span>As Jesus was going along the shore of the Sea of Galilee, he saw Simon and his brother Andrew casting a net in the Sea, for they were fishermen.</span>
<span class="verse Mark_1_17" data-osis="Mark.1.17"><span class="verse-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> &ldquo;Come and follow me,&rdquo;</span>  Jesus said, <span class="woc"> &ldquo;and I will set you to fish for men.&rdquo;</span></span>
<span class="verse Mark_1_18" data-osis="Mark.1.18"><span class="verse-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span>They left their nets at once, and followed him.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Mark_1_19" data-osis="Mark.1.19"><span class="verse-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span>Going on a little further, he saw James, Zebediah&rsquo;s son, and his brother John, who also were in their boat mending the nets.</span>
<span class="verse Mark_1_20" data-osis="Mark.1.20"><span class="verse-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span>Jesus at once called them, and they left their father Zebediah in the boat with the crew, and went after him.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Mark_1_21" data-osis="Mark.1.21"><span class="verse-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span>And they walked into Capernaum. On the next Sabbath Jesus went into the Synagogue and began to teach.</span>
<span class="verse Mark_1_22" data-osis="Mark.1.22"><span class="verse-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span>The people were amazed at his teaching, for he taught them like one who had authority, and not like the Teachers of the Law.</span>
<span class="verse Mark_1_23" data-osis="Mark.1.23"><span class="verse-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span>Now there was in their Synagogue at the time a man under the power of a foul spirit, who called out:</span>
<span class="verse Mark_1_24" data-osis="Mark.1.24"><span class="verse-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span>&ldquo;What do you want with us, Jesus of Nazareth? Have you come to destroy us? I know who you are &mdash; the Holy One of God!&rdquo;</span>
<span class="verse Mark_1_25" data-osis="Mark.1.25"><span class="verse-num v-25">25&nbsp;</span>But Jesus rebuked the spirit: <span class="woc"> &ldquo;Be silent! Come out from him.&rdquo;</span></span>
<span class="verse Mark_1_26" data-osis="Mark.1.26"><span class="verse-num v-26">26&nbsp;</span>The foul spirit threw the man into a fit, and with a loud cry came out from him.</span>
<span class="verse Mark_1_27" data-osis="Mark.1.27"><span class="verse-num v-27">27&nbsp;</span>And they were all so amazed that they kept asking: &ldquo;What is this? Strange teaching indeed! He gives his commands with authority even to the foul spirits, and they obey him!&rdquo;</span>
<span class="verse Mark_1_28" data-osis="Mark.1.28"><span class="verse-num v-28">28&nbsp;</span>And the fame of Jesus spread at once in all directions, through the whole neighbourhood of Galilee.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Mark_1_29" data-osis="Mark.1.29"><span class="verse-num v-29">29&nbsp;</span>As soon as they had come out from the Synagogue, they went, with James and John, into the house of Simon and Andrew.</span>
<span class="verse Mark_1_30" data-osis="Mark.1.30"><span class="verse-num v-30">30&nbsp;</span>Now Simon&rsquo;s mother-in-law was lying ill with fever, and they at once told Jesus about her.</span>
<span class="verse Mark_1_31" data-osis="Mark.1.31"><span class="verse-num v-31">31&nbsp;</span>Jesus went up to her and, grasping her hand, raised her up; the fever left her, and she began to wait upon them.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Mark_1_32" data-osis="Mark.1.32"><span class="verse-num v-32">32&nbsp;</span>In the evening, after sunset, the people brought to Jesus all who were ill or possessed by demons;</span>
<span class="verse Mark_1_33" data-osis="Mark.1.33"><span class="verse-num v-33">33&nbsp;</span>and the whole city was gathered round the door.</span>
<span class="verse Mark_1_34" data-osis="Mark.1.34"><span class="verse-num v-34">34&nbsp;</span>Jesus cured many who were ill with various diseases, and drove out many demons, and would not permit them to speak, because they knew him to be the Christ.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Mark_1_35" data-osis="Mark.1.35"><span class="verse-num v-35">35&nbsp;</span>In the morning, long before daylight, Jesus rose and went out, and, going to a lonely spot, there began to pray.</span>
<span class="verse Mark_1_36" data-osis="Mark.1.36"><span class="verse-num v-36">36&nbsp;</span>But Simon and his companions hastened after him;</span>
<span class="verse Mark_1_37" data-osis="Mark.1.37"><span class="verse-num v-37">37&nbsp;</span>and, when they found him, they exclaimed: &ldquo;Every one is looking for you!&rdquo;</span>
<span class="verse Mark_1_38" data-osis="Mark.1.38"><span class="verse-num v-38">38&nbsp;</span>But Jesus said to them: <span class="woc"> &ldquo;Let us go somewhere else, into the country towns near, that I may make my proclamation in them also; for that was why I came.&rdquo;</span></span>
<span class="verse Mark_1_39" data-osis="Mark.1.39"><span class="verse-num v-39">39&nbsp;</span>And he went about making his proclamation in their Synagogues all through Galilee, and driving out the demons.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse Mark_1_40" data-osis="Mark.1.40"><span class="verse-num v-40">40&nbsp;</span>One day a leper came to Jesus and, falling on his knees, begged him for help. &ldquo;If only you are willing,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;you are able to make me clean.&rdquo;</span>
<span class="verse Mark_1_41" data-osis="Mark.1.41"><span class="verse-num v-41">41&nbsp;</span>Moved with compassion, Jesus stretched out his hand and touched him, saying as he did so: <span class="woc"> &ldquo;I am willing; become clean.&rdquo;</span></span>
<span class="verse Mark_1_42" data-osis="Mark.1.42"><span class="verse-num v-42">42&nbsp;</span>Instantly the leprosy left the man, and he became clean;</span>
<span class="verse Mark_1_43" data-osis="Mark.1.43"><span class="verse-num v-43">43&nbsp;</span>and then Jesus, after sternly warning him, immediately sent him away, and said to him:</span>
<span class="verse Mark_1_44" data-osis="Mark.1.44"><span class="verse-num v-44">44&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> &ldquo;Be careful not to say anything to any one; but go and show yourself to the Priest, and make the offerings for your cleansing directed by Moses, as evidence of your cure.&rdquo;</span></span>
<span class="verse Mark_1_45" data-osis="Mark.1.45"><span class="verse-num v-45">45&nbsp;</span>The man, however, went away, and began to speak about it publicly, and to spread the story so widely, that Jesus could no longer go openly into a town, but stayed outside in lonely places; and people came to him from every direction.</span>
