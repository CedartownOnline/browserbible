<h2 class="chapter-num">5</h2>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="Rom.5.1"><span class="verse-num verse-1">1&nbsp;</span>Therefore, having been pronounced righteous as the result of faith, let us enjoy peace with God through Jesus Christ, our Lord.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Rom.5.2"><span class="verse-num">2&nbsp;</span>It is through him that, by reason of our faith, we have obtained admission to that place in God&rsquo;s favour in which we not stand. So let us exult in our hope of attaining God&rsquo;s glorious ideal.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Rom.5.3"><span class="verse-num">3&nbsp;</span>And not only that, but let us also exult in our troubles;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Rom.5.4"><span class="verse-num">4&nbsp;</span>for we know that trouble develops endurance, and endurance strength of character, and strength of character hope,</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Rom.5.5"><span class="verse-num">5&nbsp;</span>and that &lsquo;hope never disappoints.&rsquo; For the love of God has filled our hearts through the Holy Spirit which was given us;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Rom.5.6"><span class="verse-num">6&nbsp;</span>seeing that, while we were still powerless, Christ, in God&rsquo;s good time, died on behalf of the godless.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Rom.5.7"><span class="verse-num">7&nbsp;</span>Even for an upright man scarcely any one will die. For a really good man perhaps some one might even dare to die.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Rom.5.8"><span class="verse-num">8&nbsp;</span>But God puts his love for us beyond all doubt by the fact that Christ died on our behalf while we were still sinners.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Rom.5.9"><span class="verse-num">9&nbsp;</span>Much more, then, now that we have been pronounced righteous by virtue of the shedding of his blood, shall we be saved through him from the Wrath of God.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Rom.5.10"><span class="verse-num">10&nbsp;</span>For if, when we were God&rsquo;s enemies, we were reconciled to him through the death of his Son, much more, now that we have become reconciled, shall we be saved by virtue of Christ&rsquo;s Life.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Rom.5.11"><span class="verse-num">11&nbsp;</span>And not only that, but we exult in God, through Jesus Christ, our Lord, through whom we have now obtained this reconciliation.</span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="Rom.5.12"><span class="verse-num">12&nbsp;</span>Therefore, just as sin came into the world through one man, and through sin came death; so, also, death spread to all mankind, because all men had sinned.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Rom.5.13"><span class="verse-num">13&nbsp;</span>Even before the time of the Law there was sin in the world; but sin cannot be charged against a man where no Law exists.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Rom.5.14"><span class="verse-num">14&nbsp;</span>Yet, from Adam to Moses, Death reigned even over those whose sin was not a breach of a law, as Adam&rsquo;s was. And Adam foreshadows the One to come.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Rom.5.15"><span class="verse-num">15&nbsp;</span>But there is a contrast between Adam&rsquo;s Offence and God&rsquo;s gracious Gift. For, if by reason of the offence of the one man the whole race died, far more were the loving-kindness of God, and the gift given in the loving-kindness of the one man, Jesus Christ, lavished upon the whole race.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Rom.5.16"><span class="verse-num">16&nbsp;</span>There is a contrast, too, between the gift and the results of the one man&rsquo;s sin. The judgment, which followed upon the one man&rsquo;s sin, resulted in condemnation, but God&rsquo;s gracious Gift, which followed upon many offences, resulted in a decree of righteousness.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Rom.5.17"><span class="verse-num">17&nbsp;</span>For if, by reason of the offence of the one man, Death reigned through that one man, far more will those, upon whom God&rsquo;s loving- kindness and his gift of righteousness are lavished, find Life, and reign through the one man, Jesus Christ.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Rom.5.18"><span class="verse-num">18&nbsp;</span>Briefly then, just as a single offence resulted for all mankind in condemnation, so, too, a single decree of righteousness resulted for all mankind in that declaration of righteousness which brings Life.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Rom.5.19"><span class="verse-num">19&nbsp;</span>For, as through the disobedience of the one man the whole race was rendered sinful, so, too, through the obedience of the one, the whole race will be rendered righteous.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Rom.5.20"><span class="verse-num">20&nbsp;</span>Law was introduced in order that offences might be multiplied. But, where sins were multiplied, the loving-kindness of God was lavished the more,</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Rom.5.21"><span class="verse-num">21&nbsp;</span>in order than, just as Sin had reigned in the realm of Death, so, too, might Loving-kindness reign through righteousness, and result in Immortal Life, through Jesus Christ, our Lord.</span>
