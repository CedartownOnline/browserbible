<span class="verse" data-osis="1Cor.6.1"><span class="verse-num verse-1">1&nbsp;</span>Can it be that, when one of you has a dispute with another, he dares to have his case tried before the heathen, instead of before Christ&rsquo;s People?</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="1Cor.6.2"><span class="verse-num">2&nbsp;</span>Do not you know that Christ&rsquo;s People will try the world? And if the world is to be tried by you, are you unfit to try the most trivial cases?</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="1Cor.6.3"><span class="verse-num">3&nbsp;</span>Do not you know that we are to try angels-to say nothing of the affairs of this life?</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="1Cor.6.4"><span class="verse-num">4&nbsp;</span>Why, then, if you have cases relating to the affairs of this life, do you set to try them men who carry no weight with the Church? To your shame I ask it.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="1Cor.6.5"><span class="verse-num">5&nbsp;</span>Can it be that there is not one man among you wise enough to decide between two of his Brothers?</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="1Cor.6.6"><span class="verse-num">6&nbsp;</span>Must Brother go to law with Brother, and that, too, before unbelievers?</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="1Cor.6.7"><span class="verse-num">7&nbsp;</span>To begin with, it is undoubtedly a loss to you to have lawsuits with one another. Why not rather let yourselves be wronged? Why not rather let yourselves be cheated?</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="1Cor.6.8"><span class="verse-num">8&nbsp;</span>Instead of this, you wrong and cheat others yourselves-yes, even your Brothers!</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="1Cor.6.9"><span class="verse-num">9&nbsp;</span>Do not you know that wrong-doers will have no share in God&rsquo;s Kingdom? Do not be deceived. No one who is immoral, or an idolater, or an adulterer, or licentious, or a sodomite,</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="1Cor.6.10"><span class="verse-num">10&nbsp;</span>or a thief, or covetous, or a drunkard, or abusive, or grasping, will have any share in God&rsquo;s Kingdom.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="1Cor.6.11"><span class="verse-num">11&nbsp;</span>Such some of you used to be; but you washed yourselves clean. You became Christ&rsquo;s People! you were pronounced righteous through the Name of our Lord Jesus Christ, and through the Spirit of our God!</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="1Cor.6.12"><span class="verse-num">12&nbsp;</span>Everything is allowable for me! Yes, but everything is not profitable. Everything is allowable for me! Yes, but for my part, I will not let myself be enslaved by anything.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="1Cor.6.13"><span class="verse-num">13&nbsp;</span>Food exists for the stomach, and the stomach for food; but God will put an end to both the one and the other. The body, however, exists, not for immorality, but for the Lord, and the Lord for the body;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="1Cor.6.14"><span class="verse-num">14&nbsp;</span>and, as God has raised the Lord, so he will raise up us also by the exercise of his power.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="1Cor.6.15"><span class="verse-num">15&nbsp;</span>Do not you know that your bodies are Christ&rsquo;s members? Am I, then, to take the members that belong to the Christ and make them the members of a prostitute? Heaven forbid!</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="1Cor.6.16"><span class="verse-num">16&nbsp;</span>Or do not you know that a man who unites himself with a prostitute is one with her in body (for &lsquo;the two,&rsquo; it is said, &lsquo;will become one&rsquo;);</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="1Cor.6.17"><span class="verse-num">17&nbsp;</span>while a man who is united with the Lord is one with him in spirit?</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="1Cor.6.18"><span class="verse-num">18&nbsp;</span>Shun all immorality. Every other sin that men commit is something outside the body; but an immoral man sins against his own body.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="1Cor.6.19"><span class="verse-num">19&nbsp;</span>Again, do not you know that your body is a shrine of the Holy Spirit that is within you-the Spirit which you have from God?</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="1Cor.6.20"><span class="verse-num">20&nbsp;</span>Moreover, you are not your own masters; you were bought, and the price was paid. Therefore, honor God in your bodies.</span>
