<span class="verse" data-osis="John.13.1"><span class="verse-num verse-1">1&nbsp;</span>Before the Passover Festival began, Jesus knew that the time had come for him to leave the world and go to the Father. He had loved those who were his own in the world, and he loved them to the last.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.13.2"><span class="verse-num">2&nbsp;</span>The Devil had already put the thought of betraying Jesus into the mind of Judas Iscariot, the son of Simon;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.13.3"><span class="verse-num">3&nbsp;</span>and at supper, Jesus &mdash; although knowing that the Father had put everything into his hands, and that he had come from God, and was to return to God &mdash;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.13.4"><span class="verse-num">4&nbsp;</span>Rose from his place, and, taking off his upper garments, tied a towel round his waist.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.13.5"><span class="verse-num">5&nbsp;</span>He then poured some water into the basin, and began to wash the disciples&rsquo; feet, and to wipe them with the towel which was tied round him.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.13.6"><span class="verse-num">6&nbsp;</span>When he came to Simon Peter, Peter said: &ldquo;You, Master! Are you going to wash my feet?&rdquo;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.13.7"><span class="verse-num">7&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> &ldquo;You do not understand now what I am doing,&rdquo;</span>  replied Jesus, <span class="woc"> &ldquo;but you will learn by and by.&rdquo;</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.13.8"><span class="verse-num">8&nbsp;</span>&ldquo;You shall never wash my feet!&rdquo; exclaimed Peter. <span class="woc"> &ldquo;Unless I wash you,&rdquo;</span>  answered Jesus, <span class="woc"> &ldquo;you have nothing in common with me.&rdquo;</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.13.9"><span class="verse-num">9&nbsp;</span>&ldquo;Then, Master, not my feet only,&rdquo; exclaimed Simon Peter, &ldquo;but also my hands and my head.&rdquo;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.13.10"><span class="verse-num">10&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> &ldquo;He who has bathed,&rdquo;</span>  replied Jesus, <span class="woc"> &ldquo;has no need to wash, unless it be his feet, but is altogether clean; and you,&rdquo;</span>  he said to the disciples, <span class="woc"> &ldquo;are clean, yet not all of you.&rdquo;</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.13.11"><span class="verse-num">11&nbsp;</span>For he knew who was going to betray him, and that was why he said <span class="woc"> &lsquo;You are not all clean.&rsquo;</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.13.12"><span class="verse-num">12&nbsp;</span>When he had washed their feet, and had put on his upper garments and taken his place, he spoke to them again. <span class="woc"> &ldquo;Do you understand what I have been doing to you?&rdquo;</span>  he asked.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.13.13"><span class="verse-num">13&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> &ldquo;You yourselves call me &lsquo;the Teacher&rsquo; and &lsquo;the Master&rsquo;, and you are right, for I am both.</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.13.14"><span class="verse-num">14&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> If I, then &mdash; &lsquo;the Master&rsquo; and &lsquo;the Teacher&rsquo; &mdash; have washed your feet, you also ought to wash one another&rsquo;s feet;</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.13.15"><span class="verse-num">15&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> for I have given you an example, so that you may do just as I have done to you.</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.13.16"><span class="verse-num">16&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> In truth I tell you, a servant is not greater than his master, nor yet a messenger than the man who sends him.</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.13.17"><span class="verse-num">17&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> Now that you know these things, happy are you if you do them.</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.13.18"><span class="verse-num">18&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> I am not speaking about all of you. I know whom I have chosen; but this is in fulfilment of the words of Scripture &mdash; &lsquo;He that is eating my bread has lifted his heel against me.&rsquo;</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.13.19"><span class="verse-num">19&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> For the future I shall tell you of things before they take place, so that, when they take place, you may believe that I am what I am.</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.13.20"><span class="verse-num">20&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> In truth I tell you, he who receives any one that I send receives me; and he who receives me receives him who sent me.&rdquo;</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.13.21"><span class="verse-num">21&nbsp;</span>After saying this, Jesus was much troubled, and said solemnly: <span class="woc"> &ldquo;In truth I tell you that it is one of you who will betray me.&rdquo;</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.13.22"><span class="verse-num">22&nbsp;</span>The disciples looked at one another, wondering whom he meant.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.13.23"><span class="verse-num">23&nbsp;</span>Next to Jesus, in the place on his right hand, was one of his disciples, whom he loved.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.13.24"><span class="verse-num">24&nbsp;</span>So Simon Peter made signs to that disciple, and whispered: &ldquo;Tell me who it is that he means.&rdquo;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.13.25"><span class="verse-num">25&nbsp;</span>Being in this position, that disciple leant back on Jesus&rsquo; shoulder, and asked him: &ldquo;Who is it, Master?&rdquo;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.13.26"><span class="verse-num">26&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> &ldquo;It is the one,&rdquo;</span>  answered Jesus, <span class="woc"> &ldquo;to whom I shall give a piece of bread after dipping it in the dish.&rdquo;</span>  And, when Jesus had dipped the bread, he took it and gave it to Judas, the son of Simon Iscariot;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.13.27"><span class="verse-num">27&nbsp;</span>and it was then, after he had received it, that Satan took possession of him. So Jesus said to him: <span class="woc"> &ldquo;Do at once what you are going to do.&rdquo;</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.13.28"><span class="verse-num">28&nbsp;</span>But no one at table understood why he said this to Judas.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.13.29"><span class="verse-num">29&nbsp;</span>Some thought that, as Judas kept the purse, Jesus meant that he was to buy some things needed for the Festival, or to give something to the poor.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.13.30"><span class="verse-num">30&nbsp;</span>After taking the piece of bread, Judas went out immediately; and it was night.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.13.31"><span class="verse-num">31&nbsp;</span>When Judas had gone out, Jesus said: <span class="woc"> &ldquo;Now the Son of Man has been exalted, and God has been exalted through him;</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.13.32"><span class="verse-num">32&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> and God will exalt him with himself &mdash; yes, he will exalt him forthwith.</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.13.33"><span class="verse-num">33&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> My children, I am to be with you but a little while longer. You will look for me; and what I said to the Jews &mdash; &lsquo;You cannot come where I am going&rsquo; &mdash; I now say to you.</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.13.34"><span class="verse-num">34&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> I give you a new commandment &mdash; Love one another; love one another as I have loved you.</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.13.35"><span class="verse-num">35&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> It is by this that every one will recognise you as my disciples &mdash; by your loving one another.&rdquo;</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.13.36"><span class="verse-num">36&nbsp;</span>&ldquo;Where are you going, Master?&rdquo; asked Peter. <span class="woc"> &ldquo;I am going where you cannot now follow me,&rdquo;</span>  answered Jesus, <span class="woc"> &ldquo;but you shall follow me later.&rdquo;</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.13.37"><span class="verse-num">37&nbsp;</span>&ldquo;Why cannot I follow you now, Master?&rdquo; asked Peter. &ldquo;I will lay down my life for you.&rdquo;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.13.38"><span class="verse-num">38&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> &ldquo;Will you lay down your life for me?&rdquo;</span>  replied Jesus. <span class="woc"> &ldquo;In truth I tell you, the cock will not crow till you have disowned me three times.</span></span>
