<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.17.1"><span class="verse-num verse-1">1&nbsp;</span>Jesus said to his disciples: <span class="woc"> &ldquo;It is inevitable that there should be snares; yet alas for him who is answerable for them!</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.17.2"><span class="verse-num">2&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> It would be good for him if he had been flung into the sea with a mill-stone round his neck, rather than that he should prove a snare to even one of these lowly ones.</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.17.3"><span class="verse-num">3&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> Be on your guard! If your brother does wrong, reprove him; but if he repents, forgive him.</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.17.4"><span class="verse-num">4&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> Even if he wrongs you seven times a day, but turns to you every time and says &lsquo;I am sorry,&rsquo; you must forgive him.&rdquo;</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.17.5"><span class="verse-num">5&nbsp;</span>&ldquo;Give us more faith,&rdquo; said the Apostles to the Master;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.17.6"><span class="verse-num">6&nbsp;</span>but the Master said: <span class="woc"> &ldquo;If your faith were only like a mustard- seed, you could say to this mulberry tree &lsquo;Be up-rooted and planted in the sea,&rsquo; and it would obey you.</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.17.7"><span class="verse-num">7&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> Which of you, if he had a servant ploughing, or tending the sheep, would say to him, when he came in from the fields, &lsquo;Come at once and take your place at table,&rsquo;</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.17.8"><span class="verse-num">8&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> Instead of saying &lsquo;Prepare my dinner, and then make yourself ready and wait on me while I am eating and drinking, and after that you shall eat and drink yourself&rsquo;?</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.17.9"><span class="verse-num">9&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> Does he feel grateful to his servant for doing what he is told?</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.17.10"><span class="verse-num">10&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> And so with you &mdash; when you have done all that you have been told, still say &lsquo;We are but useless servants; we have done no more than we ought to have done.&rsquo;&rdquo;</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.17.11"><span class="verse-num">11&nbsp;</span>On the way to Jerusalem Jesus passed between Samaria and Galilee.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.17.12"><span class="verse-num">12&nbsp;</span>As he was entering a village, ten lepers met him.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.17.13"><span class="verse-num">13&nbsp;</span>Standing still, some distance off, they called out loudly: &ldquo;Jesus! Sir! pity us!&rdquo;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.17.14"><span class="verse-num">14&nbsp;</span>When Jesus saw them, he said: <span class="woc"> &ldquo;Go and show yourselves to the priest.&rdquo;</span>  And, as they were on their way, they were made clean.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.17.15"><span class="verse-num">15&nbsp;</span>One of them, finding he was cured, came back, praising God loudly,</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.17.16"><span class="verse-num">16&nbsp;</span>and threw himself on his face at Jesus&rsquo; feet, thanking him for what he had done; and this man was a Samaritan.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.17.17"><span class="verse-num">17&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> &ldquo;Were not all the ten made clean?</span>  exclaimed Jesus. <span class="woc"> But the nine &mdash; where are they?</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.17.18"><span class="verse-num">18&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> Were there none to come back and praise God except this foreigner?</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.17.19"><span class="verse-num">19&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> Get up,&rdquo;</span>  he said to him, <span class="woc"> &ldquo;and go on your way. Your faith has delivered you.&rdquo;</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.17.20"><span class="verse-num">20&nbsp;</span>Being once asked by the Pharisees when the Kingdom of God was to come, Jesus answered: <span class="woc"> &ldquo;The Kingdom of God does not come in a way that admits of observation,</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.17.21"><span class="verse-num">21&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> nor will people say &lsquo;Look, here it is!&rsquo; or &lsquo;There it is!&rsquo;; for the Kingdom of God is within you!</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.17.22"><span class="verse-num">22&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> The day will come,&rdquo;</span>  he said to his disciples, <span class="woc"> &ldquo;when you will long to see but one of the days of the Son of Man, and will not see it.</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.17.23"><span class="verse-num">23&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> People will say to you &lsquo;There he is! or &lsquo;Here he is!&rsquo; Do not go and follow them.</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.17.24"><span class="verse-num">24&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> For, just as lightning will lighten and flare from one side of the heavens to the other, so will it be with the Son of Man.</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.17.25"><span class="verse-num">25&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> But first he must undergo much suffering, and he must be rejected by the present generation.</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.17.26"><span class="verse-num">26&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> As it was in the days of Noah, so will it be again in the days of the Son of Man.</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.17.27"><span class="verse-num">27&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> They were eating and drinking and marrying and being married, up to the very day on which Noah entered the ark, and then the flood came and destroyed them all.</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.17.28"><span class="verse-num">28&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> So, too, in the days of Lot. People were eating, drinking, buying, selling, planting, building;</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.17.29"><span class="verse-num">29&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> but, on the very day on which Lot came out of Sodom, it rained fire and sulphur from the skies and destroyed them all.</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.17.30"><span class="verse-num">30&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> It will be the same on the day on which the Son of Man reveals himself.</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.17.31"><span class="verse-num">31&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> On that day, if a man is on his house-top and his goods in the house, he must not go down to get them; nor again must one who is on the farm turn back.</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.17.32"><span class="verse-num">32&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> Remember Lot&rsquo;s wife.</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.17.33"><span class="verse-num">33&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> Whoever is eager to get the most out of his life will lose it; but whoever will lose it shall preserve it.</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.17.34"><span class="verse-num">34&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> On that night, I tell you, of two men upon the same bed, one will be taken and the other left;</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.17.35"><span class="verse-num">35&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> of two women grinding together, one will be taken and the other left.&rdquo;</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.17.37"><span class="verse-num">37&nbsp;</span>&ldquo;Where will it be, Master?&rdquo; interposed the disciples. <span class="woc"> &ldquo;Where there is a body,&rdquo;</span>  said Jesus, <span class="woc"> &ldquo;&lsquo;there will the vultures flock.&rsquo;&rdquo;</span></span>
