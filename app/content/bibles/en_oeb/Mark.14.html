<h2 class="chapter-num">14</h2>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="Mark.14.1"><span class="verse-num verse-1">1&nbsp;</span>It was now two days before the Festival of the Passover and the Unleavened bread. The Chief Priests and the Teachers of the Law were looking for an opportunity to arrest Jesus by stealth, and to put him to death;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Mark.14.2"><span class="verse-num">2&nbsp;</span>for they said: &ldquo;Not during the Festival, for fear of a riot.&rdquo;</span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="Mark.14.3"><span class="verse-num">3&nbsp;</span>When Jesus was still at Bethany, in the house of Simon the leper, while he was at table, a woman came with an alabaster jar of choice spikenard perfume of great value. She broke the jar, and poured the perfume on his head.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Mark.14.4"><span class="verse-num">4&nbsp;</span>Some of those who were present said to one another indignantly: &ldquo;Why has the perfume been wasted like this?</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Mark.14.5"><span class="verse-num">5&nbsp;</span>This perfume could have been sold for more than thirty pounds, and the money given to the poor.&rdquo;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Mark.14.6"><span class="verse-num">6&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> &ldquo;Let her alone,&rdquo;</span>  said Jesus, as they began to find fault with her, <span class="woc"> &ldquo;why are you troubling her? This is a beautiful deed that she has done for me.</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Mark.14.7"><span class="verse-num">7&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> You always have the poor with you, and whenever you wish you can do good to them; but you will not always have me.</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Mark.14.8"><span class="verse-num">8&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> She has done what she could; she has perfumed my body beforehand for my burial.</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Mark.14.9"><span class="verse-num">9&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> And I tell you, wherever, in the whole world, the Good News is proclaimed, what this woman has done will be told in memory of her.&rdquo;</span></span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="Mark.14.10"><span class="verse-num">10&nbsp;</span>After this, Judas Iscariot, one of the Twelve, went to the Chief Priests, to betray Jesus to them.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Mark.14.11"><span class="verse-num">11&nbsp;</span>They were glad to hear what he said, and promised to pay him. So he looked for a way to betray Jesus opportunely.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Mark.14.12"><span class="verse-num">12&nbsp;</span>On the first day of the Festival of the Unleavened bread, when it was customary to kill the Passover lambs, his disciples said to Jesus: &ldquo;Where do you wish us to go and make preparations for your eating the Passover?&rdquo;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Mark.14.13"><span class="verse-num">13&nbsp;</span>Jesus sent forward two of his disciples and said to them: <span class="woc"> &ldquo;Go into the city, and there a man carrying a pitcher of water will meet you; follow him;</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Mark.14.14"><span class="verse-num">14&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> and, wherever he goes in, say to the owner of the house &lsquo;The Teacher says &mdash; Where is my room where I am to eat the Passover with my disciples?&rsquo;</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Mark.14.15"><span class="verse-num">15&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> He will himself show you a large upstairs room, set out ready; and there make preparations for us.&rdquo;</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Mark.14.16"><span class="verse-num">16&nbsp;</span>So the disciples set out and went into the city, and found everything just as Jesus had told them; and they prepared the Passover.</span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="Mark.14.17"><span class="verse-num">17&nbsp;</span>In the evening he went there with the Twelve,</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Mark.14.18"><span class="verse-num">18&nbsp;</span>and when they had taken their places and were eating, Jesus said: <span class="woc"> &ldquo;I tell you that one of you is going to betray me &mdash; one who is eating with me.&rdquo;</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Mark.14.19"><span class="verse-num">19&nbsp;</span>They were grieved at this, and began to say to him, one after another: &ldquo;Can it be I?&rdquo;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Mark.14.20"><span class="verse-num">20&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> &ldquo;It is one of you Twelve,&rdquo;</span>  said Jesus, <span class="woc"> &ldquo;the one who is dipping his bread beside me into the dish.</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Mark.14.21"><span class="verse-num">21&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> True, the Son of Man must go, as Scripture says of him, yet alas for that man by whom the Son of Man is being betrayed! For that man &lsquo;it would be better never to have been born!&rsquo;&rdquo;</span></span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="Mark.14.22"><span class="verse-num">22&nbsp;</span>While they were eating, Jesus took some bread, and, after saying the blessing, broke it, and gave it to them, and said: <span class="woc"> &ldquo;Take it; this is my body.&rdquo;</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Mark.14.23"><span class="verse-num">23&nbsp;</span>Then he took a cup, and, after saying the thanksgiving, gave it to them, and they all drank from it.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Mark.14.24"><span class="verse-num">24&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> &ldquo;This is my Covenant-blood,&rdquo;</span>  he said, <span class="woc"> &ldquo;which is poured out on behalf of many.</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Mark.14.25"><span class="verse-num">25&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> I tell you that I shall never again drink of the juice of the grape, until that day when I shall drink it new in the Kingdom of God.&rdquo;</span></span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="Mark.14.26"><span class="verse-num">26&nbsp;</span>They then sang a hymn, and went out up the Mount of Olives,</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Mark.14.27"><span class="verse-num">27&nbsp;</span>presently Jesus said to them: <span class="woc"> &ldquo;All of you will fall away; for Scripture says &mdash; &lsquo;I will strike down the Shepherd, and the sheep will be scattered.&rsquo;</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Mark.14.28"><span class="verse-num">28&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> Yet, after I have risen, I shall go before you into Galilee.&rdquo;</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Mark.14.29"><span class="verse-num">29&nbsp;</span>&ldquo;Even if every one else falls away,&rdquo; said Peter, &ldquo;yet I shall not.&rdquo;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Mark.14.30"><span class="verse-num">30&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> &ldquo;I tell you,&rdquo;</span>  answered Jesus, <span class="woc"> &ldquo;that you yourself today &mdash; yes, this very night &mdash; before the cock crows twice, will disown me three times.&rdquo;</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Mark.14.31"><span class="verse-num">31&nbsp;</span>But Peter vehemently protested: &ldquo;Even if I must die with you, I shall never disown you!&rdquo; And they all said the same.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Mark.14.32"><span class="verse-num">32&nbsp;</span>Presently they came to a garden known as Gethsemane, and Jesus said to his disciples <span class="woc"> &ldquo;Sit down here while I pray.&rdquo;</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Mark.14.33"><span class="verse-num">33&nbsp;</span>He took with him Peter, James, and John; and began to show signs of great dismay and deep distress of mind.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Mark.14.34"><span class="verse-num">34&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> &ldquo;I am sad at heart,&rdquo;</span>  he said, <span class="woc"> &ldquo;sad even to death; wait here, and watch.&rdquo;</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Mark.14.35"><span class="verse-num">35&nbsp;</span>Going on a little further, he threw himself on the ground, and began to pray that, if it were possible, he might be spared that hour.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Mark.14.36"><span class="verse-num">36&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> &ldquo;Abba, Father,&rdquo;</span>  he said, <span class="woc"> &ldquo;all things are possible to thee; take away this cup from me; yet, not what I will, but what thou willest.&rdquo;</span></span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="Mark.14.37"><span class="verse-num">37&nbsp;</span>Then he came and found the three Apostles asleep. <span class="woc"> &ldquo;Simon,&rdquo;</span>  he said to Peter, <span class="woc"> &ldquo;are you asleep? Could not you watch for one hour?</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Mark.14.38"><span class="verse-num">38&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> Watch and pray,&rdquo; he said to them all, &ldquo;that you may not fall into temptation. True, the spirit is eager, but human nature is weak.&rdquo;</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Mark.14.39"><span class="verse-num">39&nbsp;</span>Again he went away, and prayed in the same words;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Mark.14.40"><span class="verse-num">40&nbsp;</span>and coming back again he found them asleep, for their eyes were heavy; and they did not know what to say to him.</span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="Mark.14.41"><span class="verse-num">41&nbsp;</span>A third time he came, and said to them: <span class="woc"> &ldquo;Sleep on now, and rest yourselves. Enough! My time has come. Hark! the Son of Man is being betrayed into the hands of wicked men.</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Mark.14.42"><span class="verse-num">42&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> Up, and let us be going. Look! my betrayer is close at hand.&rdquo;</span></span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="Mark.14.43"><span class="verse-num">43&nbsp;</span>And just then, while he was still speaking, Judas, who was one of the Twelve, came up; and with him a crowd of people, with swords and clubs, sent by the Chief Priests, the Teachers of the Law, and the Councillors.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Mark.14.44"><span class="verse-num">44&nbsp;</span>Now the betrayer had arranged a signal with them. &ldquo;The man whom I kiss,&rdquo; he had said, &ldquo;will be the one; arrest him and take him away safely.&rdquo;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Mark.14.45"><span class="verse-num">45&nbsp;</span>As soon as Judas came, he went up to Jesus at once, and said: &ldquo;Rabbi!&rdquo; and kissed him.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Mark.14.46"><span class="verse-num">46&nbsp;</span>Then the men seized Jesus, and arrested him.</span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="Mark.14.47"><span class="verse-num">47&nbsp;</span>One of those who were standing by drew his sword, and struck at the High Priest&rsquo;s servant, and cut off his ear.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Mark.14.48"><span class="verse-num">48&nbsp;</span>But Jesus interposed, and said to the men: <span class="woc"> &ldquo;Have you come out, as if after a robber, with swords and clubs, to take me? </span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Mark.14.49"><span class="verse-num">49&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> I have been among you day after day in the Temple Courts teaching, and yet you did not arrest me; but this is in fulfilment of the Scriptures.&rdquo; </span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Mark.14.50"><span class="verse-num">50&nbsp;</span>And all the Apostles forsook him, and fled.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Mark.14.51"><span class="verse-num">51&nbsp;</span>One young man did indeed follow him, wrapped only in a linen sheet. They tried to arrest him;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Mark.14.52"><span class="verse-num">52&nbsp;</span>but he left the sheet in their hands, and fled naked.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Mark.14.53"><span class="verse-num">53&nbsp;</span>Then they took Jesus to the High Priest; and all the Chief Priests, the Councillors, and the Teachers of the Law assembled.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Mark.14.54"><span class="verse-num">54&nbsp;</span>Peter, who had followed Jesus at a distance into the court- yard of the High Priest, was sitting there among the police- officers, warming himself at the blaze of the fire.</span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="Mark.14.55"><span class="verse-num">55&nbsp;</span>Meanwhile the Chief Priest and the whole of the High Council were trying to get such evidence against Jesus as would warrant his being put to death, but they could not find any;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Mark.14.56"><span class="verse-num">56&nbsp;</span>for, though there were many who gave false evidence against him, yet their evidence did not agree.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Mark.14.57"><span class="verse-num">57&nbsp;</span>Presently some men stood up, and gave this false evidence against him &mdash;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Mark.14.58"><span class="verse-num">58&nbsp;</span>&ldquo;We ourselves heard him say &lsquo;I will destroy this Temple made with hands, and in three days build another made without hands.&rsquo;&rdquo;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Mark.14.59"><span class="verse-num">59&nbsp;</span>Yet not even on that point did their evidence agree.</span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="Mark.14.60"><span class="verse-num">60&nbsp;</span>Then the High Priest stood forward, and questioned Jesus. &ldquo;Have you no answer to make?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;What is this evidence which these men are giving against you?&rdquo;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Mark.14.61"><span class="verse-num">61&nbsp;</span>But Jesus remained silent, and made no answer.</span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="Mark.14.62"><span class="verse-num">62&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> &ldquo;I am,&rdquo;</span>  replied Jesus, <span class="woc"> &ldquo;and you shall all see the Son of Man sitting on the right hand of the Almighty; and &lsquo;coming in the clouds of heaven&rsquo;.&rdquo;</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Mark.14.63"><span class="verse-num">63&nbsp;</span>At this the High Priest tore his vestments. &ldquo;Why do we want any more witnesses?&rdquo; he exclaimed.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Mark.14.64"><span class="verse-num">64&nbsp;</span>&ldquo;You heard his blasphemy? What is your verdict?&rdquo; They all condemned him, declaring that he deserved death.</span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="Mark.14.65"><span class="verse-num">65&nbsp;</span>Some of those present began to spit at him, and to blindfold his eyes, and strike him, saying, as they did so, &ldquo;Now play the Prophet!&rdquo; and even the police-officers received him with blows.</span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="Mark.14.66"><span class="verse-num">66&nbsp;</span>While Peter was in the court-yard down below, one of the High Priest&rsquo;s maidservants came up;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Mark.14.67"><span class="verse-num">67&nbsp;</span>and, seeing Peter warming himself, she looked closely at him, and exclaimed: &ldquo;Why, you were with Jesus, the Nazarene!&rdquo;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Mark.14.68"><span class="verse-num">68&nbsp;</span>But Peter denied it. &ldquo;I do not know or understand what you mean,&rdquo; he replied. Then he went out into the porch;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Mark.14.69"><span class="verse-num">69&nbsp;</span>and there the maidservant, on seeing him, began to say again to the by-standers: &ldquo;This is one of them!&rdquo;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Mark.14.70"><span class="verse-num">70&nbsp;</span>But Peter again denied it.</span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="Mark.14.71"><span class="verse-num">71&nbsp;</span>But he began to swear with the most solemn imprecations: &ldquo;I do not know the man you are speaking about.&rdquo;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Mark.14.72"><span class="verse-num">72&nbsp;</span>At that moment, for the second time, a cock crowed; and Peter remembered the words that Jesus had said to him &mdash; <span class="woc"> &lsquo;Before a cock has crowed twice, you will disown me three times&rsquo;;</span>  and, as he thought of it, he began to weep.</span>
