<span class="verse 1Thess_5_2" data-osis="1Thess.5.2"><span class="verse-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span>You yourselves know well that the Day of the Lord will come just as a thief comes in the night.</span>
<span class="verse 1Thess_5_3" data-osis="1Thess.5.3"><span class="verse-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span>When people are saying &lsquo;All is quiet and safe,&rsquo; it is then that, like birth-pains upon a woman with child, Ruin comes suddenly upon them, and there will be no escape!</span>
<span class="verse 1Thess_5_4" data-osis="1Thess.5.4"><span class="verse-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span>You, however, Brothers, are not in darkness, that the daylight should take you by surprise as if you were thieves.</span>
<span class="verse 1Thess_5_5" data-osis="1Thess.5.5"><span class="verse-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span>For you all are &lsquo;Sons of Light&rsquo; and &lsquo;Sons of the Day.&rsquo; We have nothing to do with night, or darkness.</span>
<span class="verse 1Thess_5_6" data-osis="1Thess.5.6"><span class="verse-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span>Therefore let us not sleep as others do. No, let us be watchful and self-controlled.</span>
<span class="verse 1Thess_5_7" data-osis="1Thess.5.7"><span class="verse-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span>It is at night that men sleep, and at night that drunkards get drunk.</span>
<span class="verse 1Thess_5_8" data-osis="1Thess.5.8"><span class="verse-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span>But let us, who belong to the Day, control ourselves, and put on faith and love as a breast plate, and the hope of Salvation as a helmet.</span>
<span class="verse 1Thess_5_9" data-osis="1Thess.5.9"><span class="verse-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span>For God destined us, not for Wrath, but to win Salvation through our Lord Jesus Christ, who died for us,</span>
<span class="verse 1Thess_5_10" data-osis="1Thess.5.10"><span class="verse-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span>that, whether we are still watching or have fallen asleep, we may live with him.</span>

<span class="verse 1Thess_5_14" data-osis="1Thess.5.14"><span class="verse-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span>We entreat you also, Brothers &mdash; warn the disorderly, comfort the faint-hearted, give a helping hand to the weak, and be patient with every one.</span>
<span class="verse 1Thess_5_15" data-osis="1Thess.5.15"><span class="verse-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span>Take care that none of you ever pays back wrong for wrong, but always follow the kindest course with one another and with every one.</span>
<span class="verse 1Thess_5_16" data-osis="1Thess.5.16"><span class="verse-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span>Always be joyful;</span>

<span class="verse 1Thess_5_22" data-osis="1Thess.5.22"><span class="verse-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span>shun every form of evil.</span>
<span class="verse 1Thess_5_23" data-osis="1Thess.5.23"><span class="verse-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span>May God himself, the giver of peace, make you altogether holy; and may your spirits, souls, and bodies be kept altogether faultless until the Coming of our Lord Jesus Christ.</span>
<span class="verse 1Thess_5_24" data-osis="1Thess.5.24"><span class="verse-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span>He who calls you will not fail you; he will complete his work.</span>
