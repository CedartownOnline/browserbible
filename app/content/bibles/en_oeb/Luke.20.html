<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.20.1"><span class="verse-num verse-1">1&nbsp;</span>On one of these days, when Jesus was teaching the people in the Temple Courts and telling the Good News, the Chief Priests and the Teachers of the Law, joined by the Councillors, confronted him,</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.20.2"><span class="verse-num">2&nbsp;</span>and addressing him, said: &ldquo;Tell us what authority you have to do these things. Who is it that has given you this authority?&rdquo;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.20.3"><span class="verse-num">3&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> &ldquo;I, too,&rdquo;</span>  said Jesus in reply, <span class="woc"> &ldquo;will ask you one question. Give me an answer to it.</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.20.4"><span class="verse-num">4&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> It is about John&rsquo;s baptism &mdash; was it of divine or of human origin?&rdquo;</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.20.5"><span class="verse-num">5&nbsp;</span>But they began arguing together: &ldquo;If we say &lsquo;divine,&rsquo; he will say &lsquo;Why did not you believe him?&rsquo;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.20.6"><span class="verse-num">6&nbsp;</span>But, if we say &lsquo;human,&rsquo; the people will all stone us, for they are persuaded that John was a Prophet.&rdquo;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.20.7"><span class="verse-num">7&nbsp;</span>So they answered that they did not know its origin.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.20.8"><span class="verse-num">8&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> &ldquo;Then I,&rdquo;</span>  said Jesus, <span class="woc"> &ldquo;refuse to tell you what authority I have to do these things.&rdquo;</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.20.9"><span class="verse-num">9&nbsp;</span>But Jesus began to tell the people this parable &mdash; <span class="woc"> &ldquo;A man once planted a vineyard, and then let it out to tenants, and went abroad for a long while.</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.20.10"><span class="verse-num">10&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> At the proper time he sent a servant to the tenants, that they should give him a share of the produce of the vineyard. The tenants, however, beat him and sent him away empty-handed.</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.20.11"><span class="verse-num">11&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> The owner afterwards sent another servant; but the tenants beat and insulted this man too, and sent him away empty-handed.</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.20.12"><span class="verse-num">12&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> He sent a third; but they wounded this man also, and threw him outside.</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.20.13"><span class="verse-num">13&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> &lsquo;What shall I do?&rsquo; said the owner of the vineyard. &lsquo;I will send my son, who is very dear to me. Perhaps they will respect him.&rsquo;</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.20.14"><span class="verse-num">14&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> But, on seeing him, the tenants consulted with one another. &lsquo;Here is the heir!&rsquo; they said. &lsquo;Let us kill him, and then the inheritance will become ours.&rsquo;</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.20.15"><span class="verse-num">15&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> So they threw him outside the vineyard and killed him. Now what will the owner of the vineyard do to them?</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.20.16"><span class="verse-num">16&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> He will come and put those tenants to death, and will let the vineyard to others.&rdquo;</span>  &ldquo;Heaven forbid!&rdquo; they exclaimed when they heard it.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.20.17"><span class="verse-num">17&nbsp;</span>But Jesus looked at them and said: <span class="woc"> &ldquo;What then is the meaning of this passage? &mdash;  &lsquo;The very stone which the builders despised has now itself become the corner-stone.&rsquo;</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.20.18"><span class="verse-num">18&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> Every one who falls on that stone will be dashed to pieces, while any one on whom it falls &mdash; it will scatter him as dust.&rdquo;</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.20.19"><span class="verse-num">19&nbsp;</span>After this the Teachers of the Law and the Chief Priest were eager to lay hands on Jesus then and there, but they were afraid of the people; for they saw that it was at them that he had aimed this parable.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.20.20"><span class="verse-num">20&nbsp;</span>Having watched their opportunity, they afterwards sent some spies, who pretended to be good men, to catch Jesus in the course of conversation, and so enable them to give him up to the Governor&rsquo;s jurisdiction and authority.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.20.21"><span class="verse-num">21&nbsp;</span>These men asked Jesus a question. They said: &ldquo;Teacher, we know that you are right in what you say and teach, and that you do not take any account of a man&rsquo;s position, but teach the Way of God honestly;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.20.22"><span class="verse-num">22&nbsp;</span>are we right in paying tribute to the Emperor or not?&rdquo;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.20.23"><span class="verse-num">23&nbsp;</span>Seeing through their deceitfulness, Jesus said to them:</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.20.24"><span class="verse-num">24&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> &ldquo;Show me a florin. Whose head and title are on it?&rdquo;</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.20.25"><span class="verse-num">25&nbsp;</span>&ldquo;The Emperor&rsquo;s,&rdquo; they said; and Jesus replied: <span class="woc"> &ldquo;Well then, pay to the Emperor what belongs to the Emperor, and to God what belongs to God.&rdquo;</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.20.26"><span class="verse-num">26&nbsp;</span>They could not lay hold of this answer before the people; and, in their wonder at his reply, they held their tongues.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.20.27"><span class="verse-num">27&nbsp;</span>Presently there came up some Sadducees, who maintain that there is no resurrection. Their question was this &mdash;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.20.28"><span class="verse-num">28&nbsp;</span>&ldquo;Teacher, Moses laid down for us in his writings that &mdash;  &lsquo;Should a man&rsquo;s married brother die, and should he be childless, the man should take the widow as his wife, and raise up a family for his brother.&rsquo;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.20.29"><span class="verse-num">29&nbsp;</span>Well, there were once seven brothers; of whom the eldest, after taking a wife, died childless.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.20.30"><span class="verse-num">30&nbsp;</span>The second and third brothers both took her as their wife;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.20.31"><span class="verse-num">31&nbsp;</span>and so, too, did all seven &mdash; dying without children.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.20.32"><span class="verse-num">32&nbsp;</span>The woman herself was the last to die.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.20.33"><span class="verse-num">33&nbsp;</span>About the woman, then &mdash; at the resurrection, whose wife is she to be, all seven brothers having had her as their wife?&rdquo;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.20.34"><span class="verse-num">34&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> &ldquo;The men and women of this world,&rdquo;</span>  said Jesus, <span class="woc"> &ldquo;marry and are given in marriage;</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.20.35"><span class="verse-num">35&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> but, for those who are thought worthy to attain to that other world and the resurrection from the dead, there is no marrying or being married,</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.20.36"><span class="verse-num">36&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> nor indeed can they die again, for they are like angels and, having shared in the resurrection, they are God&rsquo;s Sons.</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.20.37"><span class="verse-num">37&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> As to the fact that the dead rise, even Moses indicated that, in the passage about the Bush, when he calls the Lord &mdash; &lsquo;The God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob.&rsquo;</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.20.38"><span class="verse-num">38&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> Now he is not God of dead men, but of living. For in his sight all are alive.&rdquo;</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.20.39"><span class="verse-num">39&nbsp;</span>&ldquo;Well said, Teacher!&rdquo; exclaimed some of the Teachers of the Law,</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.20.40"><span class="verse-num">40&nbsp;</span>for they did not venture to question him any further.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.20.41"><span class="verse-num">41&nbsp;</span>But Jesus said to them: <span class="woc"> &ldquo;How is it that people say that the Christ is to be David&rsquo;s son?</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.20.42"><span class="verse-num">42&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> For David, in the Book of Psalms, says himself &mdash; &lsquo;The Lord said to my lord: &ldquo;Sit at my right hand,</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.20.43"><span class="verse-num">43&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> until I put they enemies as a stool for thy feet.&rdquo;&rsquo;</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.20.44"><span class="verse-num">44&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> David, then, calls him &lsquo;lord,&rsquo; so how is he David&rsquo;s son?&rdquo;</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.20.45"><span class="verse-num">45&nbsp;</span>While all the people were listening, Jesus said to the disciples:</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.20.46"><span class="verse-num">46&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> &ldquo;Be on your guard against the Teachers of the Law, who delight to walk about in long robes, and like to be greeted in the streets with respect, and to have the best seats in the Synagogues, and places of honour at dinner.</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.20.47"><span class="verse-num">47&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> These are the men who rob widows of their houses, and make a pretence of saying long prayers. Their sentence will be all the heavier.&rdquo;</span></span>
