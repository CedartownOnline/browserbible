<span class="verse Luke_18_1" data-osis="Luke.18.1"><span class="verse-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span>Jesus told his disciples a parable to show them that they should always pray and never despair.</span>
<span class="verse Luke_18_2" data-osis="Luke.18.2"><span class="verse-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> &ldquo;There was,&rdquo;</span>  he said, <span class="woc"> &ldquo;in a certain town a judge, who had no fear of God nor regard for man.</span></span>
<span class="verse Luke_18_3" data-osis="Luke.18.3"><span class="verse-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> In the same town there was a widow who went to him again and again, and said &lsquo;Grant me justice against my opponent.&rsquo;</span></span>
<span class="verse Luke_18_4" data-osis="Luke.18.4"><span class="verse-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> For a time the judge refused, but afterwards he said to himself &lsquo;Although I am without fear of God or regard for man,</span></span>
<span class="verse Luke_18_5" data-osis="Luke.18.5"><span class="verse-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> yet, as this widow is so troublesome, I will grant her justice, to stop her from plaguing me with her endless visits.&rsquo;&rdquo;</span></span>
<span class="verse Luke_18_6" data-osis="Luke.18.6"><span class="verse-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span>Then the Master added: <span class="woc"> &ldquo;Listen to what this iniquitous judge says!</span></span>
<span class="verse Luke_18_7" data-osis="Luke.18.7"><span class="verse-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> And God &mdash; will not he see that his own People, who cry to him night and day, have justice done them &mdash; though he holds his hand?</span></span>
<span class="verse Luke_18_8" data-osis="Luke.18.8"><span class="verse-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> He will, I tell you, have justice done them, and that soon! Yet, when the Son of Man comes, will he find faith on earth?&rdquo;</span></span>
<span class="verse Luke_18_9" data-osis="Luke.18.9"><span class="verse-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span>Another time, speaking to people who were satisfied that they were religious, and who regarded every one else with scorn, Jesus told this parable &mdash;</span>
<span class="verse Luke_18_10" data-osis="Luke.18.10"><span class="verse-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> &ldquo;Two men went up into the Temple Courts to pray. One was a Pharisee and the other a tax-gatherer.</span></span>
<span class="verse Luke_18_11" data-osis="Luke.18.11"><span class="verse-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> The Pharisee stood forward and began praying to himself in this way &mdash; &lsquo;O God, I thank thee that I am not like other men &mdash;  thieves, rogues, adulterers &mdash; or even like this tax-gatherer.</span></span>
<span class="verse Luke_18_12" data-osis="Luke.18.12"><span class="verse-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> I fast twice a week, and give a tenth of everything I get to God.&rsquo;</span></span>
<span class="verse Luke_18_13" data-osis="Luke.18.13"><span class="verse-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> Meanwhile the tax-gatherer stood at a distance, not venturing even &lsquo;to raise his eyes to Heaven&rsquo;; but he kept striking his breast and saying &lsquo;O God, have mercy on me, a sinner.&rsquo;</span></span>
<span class="verse Luke_18_14" data-osis="Luke.18.14"><span class="verse-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> This man, I tell you, went home pardoned, rather than the other; for every one who exalts himself will be humbled, while every one who humbles himself shall be exalted.&rdquo;</span></span>
<span class="verse Luke_18_15" data-osis="Luke.18.15"><span class="verse-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span>Some of the people were bringing even their babies to Jesus, for him to touch them; but, when the disciples saw it, they began to find fault with those who had brought them.</span>
<span class="verse Luke_18_16" data-osis="Luke.18.16"><span class="verse-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span>Jesus, however, called the little children to him. <span class="woc"> &ldquo;Let the little children come to me,&rdquo;</span>  he said, <span class="woc"> &ldquo;and do not hinder them; for it is to the childlike that the Kingdom of God belongs.</span></span>
<span class="verse Luke_18_17" data-osis="Luke.18.17"><span class="verse-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> I tell you, unless a man receives the Kingdom of God like a child, he will not enter it at all.&rdquo;</span></span>
<span class="verse Luke_18_18" data-osis="Luke.18.18"><span class="verse-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span>And one of the Presidents asked Jesus this question &mdash; &ldquo;Good Teacher, what must I do if I am to gain Immortal Life?&rdquo;</span>
<span class="verse Luke_18_19" data-osis="Luke.18.19"><span class="verse-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> &ldquo;Why do you call me good?&rdquo;</span>  answered Jesus. <span class="woc"> &ldquo;No one is good but God.</span></span>
<span class="verse Luke_18_20" data-osis="Luke.18.20"><span class="verse-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> You know the commandments &mdash; &lsquo;Do not commit adultery, Do not kill, Do not steal, Do not say what is false about others, Honour thy father and thy mother.&rsquo;&rdquo;</span></span>
<span class="verse Luke_18_21" data-osis="Luke.18.21"><span class="verse-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span>&ldquo;I have observed all these,&rdquo; he replied, &ldquo;from childhood.&rdquo;</span>
<span class="verse Luke_18_22" data-osis="Luke.18.22"><span class="verse-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span>Hearing this, Jesus said to him: <span class="woc"> &ldquo;There is one thing still lacking in you; sell everything that you have, and distribute to the poor, and you shall have wealth in Heaven; then come and follow me.&rdquo;</span></span>
<span class="verse Luke_18_23" data-osis="Luke.18.23"><span class="verse-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span>But the man became greatly distressed on hearing this, for he was extremely rich.</span>
<span class="verse Luke_18_24" data-osis="Luke.18.24"><span class="verse-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span>Seeing this, Jesus said to his disciples: <span class="woc"> &ldquo;How hard it is for men of wealth to enter the Kingdom of God!</span></span>
<span class="verse Luke_18_25" data-osis="Luke.18.25"><span class="verse-num v-25">25&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> It is easier, indeed, for a camel to get through a needle&rsquo;s eye than for a rich man to enter the Kingdom of God!&rdquo;</span></span>
<span class="verse Luke_18_26" data-osis="Luke.18.26"><span class="verse-num v-26">26&nbsp;</span>&ldquo;Then who can be saved?&rdquo; asked those who heard this.</span>
<span class="verse Luke_18_27" data-osis="Luke.18.27"><span class="verse-num v-27">27&nbsp;</span>But Jesus said: <span class="woc"> &ldquo;What is impossible with men is possible with God.&rdquo;</span></span>
<span class="verse Luke_18_28" data-osis="Luke.18.28"><span class="verse-num v-28">28&nbsp;</span>&ldquo;But we,&rdquo; said Peter, &ldquo;we left what belonged to us and followed you.&rdquo;</span>
<span class="verse Luke_18_29" data-osis="Luke.18.29"><span class="verse-num v-29">29&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> &ldquo;I tell you,&rdquo;</span>  he answered, <span class="woc"> &ldquo;that there is no one who has left house, or wife, or brothers, or parents, or children, on account of the Kingdom of God,</span></span>
<span class="verse Luke_18_30" data-osis="Luke.18.30"><span class="verse-num v-30">30&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> who will not receive many times as much in the present, and in the age that is coming Immortal Life.&rdquo;</span></span>
<span class="verse Luke_18_31" data-osis="Luke.18.31"><span class="verse-num v-31">31&nbsp;</span>Gathering the Twelve round him, Jesus said to them: <span class="woc"> &ldquo;Listen! We are going up to Jerusalem; and there everything that is written in the Prophets will be done to the Son of Man.</span></span>
<span class="verse Luke_18_32" data-osis="Luke.18.32"><span class="verse-num v-32">32&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> For he will be given up to the Gentiles, mocked, insulted and spat upon;</span></span>
<span class="verse Luke_18_33" data-osis="Luke.18.33"><span class="verse-num v-33">33&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> they will scourge him, and then put him to death; and on the third day he will rise again.&rdquo;</span></span>
<span class="verse Luke_18_34" data-osis="Luke.18.34"><span class="verse-num v-34">34&nbsp;</span>The Apostles did not comprehend any of this; his meaning was unintelligible to them, and they did not understand what he was saying.</span>
<span class="verse Luke_18_35" data-osis="Luke.18.35"><span class="verse-num v-35">35&nbsp;</span>As Jesus was getting near Jericho, a blind man was sitting by the road-side, begging.</span>
<span class="verse Luke_18_36" data-osis="Luke.18.36"><span class="verse-num v-36">36&nbsp;</span>Hearing a crowd going by, the man asked what was the matter;</span>
<span class="verse Luke_18_37" data-osis="Luke.18.37"><span class="verse-num v-37">37&nbsp;</span>and, when people told him that Jesus of Nazareth was passing,</span>
<span class="verse Luke_18_38" data-osis="Luke.18.38"><span class="verse-num v-38">38&nbsp;</span>he shouted out: &ldquo;Jesus, Son of David, take pity on me!&rdquo;</span>
<span class="verse Luke_18_39" data-osis="Luke.18.39"><span class="verse-num v-39">39&nbsp;</span>Those who were in front kept telling him to be quiet, but he continued to call out the louder: &ldquo;Son of David, take pity on me!&rdquo;</span>
<span class="verse Luke_18_40" data-osis="Luke.18.40"><span class="verse-num v-40">40&nbsp;</span>Then Jesus stopped and ordered the man to be brought to him. And, when he had come close up to him, Jesus asked him:</span>
<span class="verse Luke_18_41" data-osis="Luke.18.41"><span class="verse-num v-41">41&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> &ldquo;What do you want me to do for you?&rdquo;</span>  &ldquo;Master,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I want to recover my sight.&rdquo;</span>
<span class="verse Luke_18_42" data-osis="Luke.18.42"><span class="verse-num v-42">42&nbsp;</span>And Jesus said: <span class="woc"> &ldquo;Recover your sight, your faith has delivered you.&rdquo;</span></span>
<span class="verse Luke_18_43" data-osis="Luke.18.43"><span class="verse-num v-43">43&nbsp;</span>Instantly he recovered his sight, and began to follow Jesus, praising God. And all the people, on seeing it, gave glory to God.</span>
