<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.22.1"><span class="verse-num verse-1">1&nbsp;</span>The Feast of the Unleavened Bread, known as the Passover, was near.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.22.2"><span class="verse-num">2&nbsp;</span>The Chief Priest and the Teachers of the Law were looking for an opportunity of destroying Jesus, for they were afraid of the people.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.22.3"><span class="verse-num">3&nbsp;</span>Now Satan took possession of Judas, who was known as Iscariot, and who belonged to the Twelve;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.22.4"><span class="verse-num">4&nbsp;</span>and he went and discussed with the Chief Priests and Officers in charge at the Temple the best way of betraying Jesus to them.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.22.5"><span class="verse-num">5&nbsp;</span>They were glad of this, and agreed to pay him.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.22.6"><span class="verse-num">6&nbsp;</span>So Judas assented, and looked for an opportunity to betray Jesus to them, in the absence of a crowd.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.22.7"><span class="verse-num">7&nbsp;</span>When the day of the Festival of the Unleavened Bread came, on which the Passover lambs had to be killed,</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.22.8"><span class="verse-num">8&nbsp;</span>Jesus sent forward Peter and John, saying to them: <span class="woc"> &ldquo;Go and make preparations for our eating the Passover.&rdquo;</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.22.9"><span class="verse-num">9&nbsp;</span>&ldquo;Where do you wish us to make preparations?&rdquo; they asked.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.22.10"><span class="verse-num">10&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> &ldquo;Listen,&rdquo;</span>  he answered, <span class="woc"> &ldquo;when you have got into the city, a man carrying a pitcher of water will meet you; follow him into whatever house he enters;</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.22.11"><span class="verse-num">11&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> and you shall say to the owner of the house &lsquo;The Teacher says to you &mdash; Where is the room where I am to eat the Passover with my disciples?&rsquo;</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.22.12"><span class="verse-num">12&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> The man will show you a large upstairs room, set out; there make preparations.&rdquo;</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.22.13"><span class="verse-num">13&nbsp;</span>So Peter and John went on, and found everything just as Jesus had told them, and they prepared the Passover.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.22.14"><span class="verse-num">14&nbsp;</span>When the time came, Jesus took his place at table, and the Apostles with him.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.22.15"><span class="verse-num">15&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> &ldquo;I have most earnestly wished,&rdquo;</span>  he said, <span class="woc"> &ldquo;to eat this Passover with you before I suffer.</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.22.16"><span class="verse-num">16&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> For I tell you that I shall not eat it again, until it has had its fulfilment in the Kingdom of God.&rdquo;</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.22.17"><span class="verse-num">17&nbsp;</span>Then, on receiving a cup, after saying the thanksgiving, he said:</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.22.18"><span class="verse-num">18&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> &ldquo;Take this and share it among you. For I tell you that I shall not, after to-day, drink of the juice of the grape, till the Kingdom of God has come.&rdquo;</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.22.19"><span class="verse-num">19&nbsp;</span>Then Jesus took some bread, and, after saying the thanksgiving, broke it and gave to them, with the words: <span class="woc"> &ldquo;This is my body, [which is now to be given on your behalf. Do this in memory of me.&rdquo;</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.22.20"><span class="verse-num">20&nbsp;</span>And in the same way with the cup, after supper, saying: <span class="woc"> &ldquo;This cup is the New Covenant made by my blood which is being poured out on your behalf.]</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.22.21"><span class="verse-num">21&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> Yet see! the hand of the man that is betraying me is beside me upon the table!</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.22.22"><span class="verse-num">22&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> True, the Son of Man is passing, by the way ordained for him, yet alas for that man by whom he is being betrayed!&rdquo;</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.22.23"><span class="verse-num">23&nbsp;</span>Then they began questioning one another which of them it could be that was going to do this.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.22.24"><span class="verse-num">24&nbsp;</span>And a dispute arose among them as to which of them was to be regarded as the greatest.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.22.25"><span class="verse-num">25&nbsp;</span>Jesus, however, said: <span class="woc"> &ldquo;The kings of the Gentiles lord it over them, and their oppressors are styled &lsquo;Benefactors.&rsquo;</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.22.26"><span class="verse-num">26&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> But with you it must not be so. No, let the greatest among you become like the youngest, and him who leads like him who serves.</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.22.27"><span class="verse-num">27&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> Which is the greater &mdash; the master at the table or his servant? Is not it the master at the table? Yet I myself am among you as one who serves.</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.22.28"><span class="verse-num">28&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> You are the men who have stood by me in my trials;</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.22.29"><span class="verse-num">29&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> and, just as my Father has assigned me a Kingdom, I assign you places,</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.22.30"><span class="verse-num">30&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> so that you may eat and drink at my table in my Kingdom, and be seated upon twelve thrones as judges of the twelve tribes of Israel.</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.22.31"><span class="verse-num">31&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> Simon! Simon! listen. Satan demanded leave to sift you all like wheat,</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.22.32"><span class="verse-num">32&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> but I prayed for you, Simon, that your faith should not fail. And you, when you have returned to me, are to strengthen your Brothers.&rdquo;</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.22.33"><span class="verse-num">33&nbsp;</span>&ldquo;Master,&rdquo; said Peter, &ldquo;with you I am ready to go both to prison and to death.&rdquo;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.22.34"><span class="verse-num">34&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> &ldquo;I tell you, Peter,&rdquo;</span>  replied Jesus, <span class="woc"> &ldquo;the cock will not crow to-day till you have disowned all knowledge of me three times.&rdquo;</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.22.35"><span class="verse-num">35&nbsp;</span>Then he said to them all: <span class="woc"> &ldquo;When I sent you out as my Messengers, without either purse, or bag, or sandals, were you in need of anything?&rdquo;</span>  &ldquo;No; nothing,&rdquo; they answered.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.22.36"><span class="verse-num">36&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> &ldquo;Now, however,&rdquo;</span>  he said, <span class="woc"> &ldquo;he who has a purse must take it and his bag as well; and he who has not must sell his cloak and buy a sword.</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.22.37"><span class="verse-num">37&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> For, I tell you, that passage of Scripture must be fulfilled in me, which says &mdash; &lsquo;He was counted among the godless&rsquo;; indeed all that refers to me is finding its fulfilment.&rdquo;</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.22.38"><span class="verse-num">38&nbsp;</span>&ldquo;Master,&rdquo; they exclaimed, &ldquo;look, here are two swords!&rdquo; <span class="woc"> &ldquo;Enough!&rdquo;</span>  said Jesus.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.22.39"><span class="verse-num">39&nbsp;</span>Jesus then went out, and made his way as usual to the Mount of Olives, followed by his disciples.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.22.40"><span class="verse-num">40&nbsp;</span>And, when he reached the spot, he said to them: <span class="woc"> &ldquo;Pray that you may not fall into temptation.&rdquo;</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.22.41"><span class="verse-num">41&nbsp;</span>Then he withdrew about a stone&rsquo;s throw, and knelt down and began to pray.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.22.42"><span class="verse-num">42&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> &ldquo;Father,&rdquo;</span>  he said, <span class="woc"> &ldquo;if it is thy pleasure, spare me this cup; only, not my will but thine be done.&rdquo;</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.22.43"><span class="verse-num">43&nbsp;</span>[Presently there appeared to him an angel from Heaven, who strengthened him.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.22.44"><span class="verse-num">44&nbsp;</span>And, as his anguish became intense, he prayed still more earnestly, while his sweat was like great drops of blood falling on the ground.]</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.22.45"><span class="verse-num">45&nbsp;</span>Then he rose from praying, and came to the disciples and found them sleeping for sorrow.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.22.46"><span class="verse-num">46&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> &ldquo;Why are you asleep?&rdquo;</span>  he asked them. <span class="woc"> &ldquo;Rise and pray, that you may not fall into temptation.&rdquo;</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.22.47"><span class="verse-num">47&nbsp;</span>While he was still speaking, a crowd appeared in sight, led by the man called Judas, who was one of the Twelve. Judas approached Jesus, to kiss him;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.22.48"><span class="verse-num">48&nbsp;</span>on which Jesus said to him: <span class="woc"> &ldquo;Judas, is it by a kiss that you betray the Son of Man?&rdquo;</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.22.49"><span class="verse-num">49&nbsp;</span>But when those who were round Jesus saw what was going to happen, they exclaimed: &ldquo;Master, shall we use our swords?&rdquo;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.22.50"><span class="verse-num">50&nbsp;</span>And one of them struck the High Priest&rsquo;s servant and cut off his right ear;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.22.51"><span class="verse-num">51&nbsp;</span>on which Jesus said: <span class="woc"> &ldquo;Let me at least do this&rdquo;; and, touching his ear, he healed the wound.</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.22.52"><span class="verse-num">52&nbsp;</span>Then, turning to the Chief Priests and Officers in charge at the Temple and Councillors, who had come for him, he said: <span class="woc"> &ldquo;Have you come out, as if after a robber, with swords and clubs?</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.22.53"><span class="verse-num">53&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> When I was with you day after day in the Temple Courts, you did not lay hands on me; but now your time has come, and the power of Darkness.&rdquo;</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.22.54"><span class="verse-num">54&nbsp;</span>Those who had taken Jesus prisoner took him away into the house of the High Priest. Peter followed at a distance.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.22.55"><span class="verse-num">55&nbsp;</span>But, when they had lit a fire in the centre of the court-yard and had all sat down there, Peter seated himself in the middle of them.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.22.56"><span class="verse-num">56&nbsp;</span>Presently a maidservant saw him sitting near the blaze of the fire. Fixing her eyes on him, she said: &ldquo;Why, this man was one of his companions!&rdquo;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.22.57"><span class="verse-num">57&nbsp;</span>But Peter denied it. &ldquo;I do not know him,&rdquo; he replied.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.22.58"><span class="verse-num">58&nbsp;</span>A little while afterwards some one else &mdash; a man &mdash; saw him and said: &ldquo;Why, you are one of them!&rdquo; &ldquo;No,&rdquo; Peter said, &ldquo;I am not.&rdquo;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.22.59"><span class="verse-num">59&nbsp;</span>About an hour later another man declared positively: &ldquo;This man also was certainly with him. Why, he is a Galilean!&rdquo;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.22.60"><span class="verse-num">60&nbsp;</span>But Peter said: &ldquo;I do not know what you are speaking about.&rdquo; Instantly, while he was still speaking, a cock crowed.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.22.61"><span class="verse-num">61&nbsp;</span>And the Master turned and looked at Peter; and Peter remembered the words that the Master had said to him &mdash; <span class="woc"> &ldquo;Before a cock has crowed to-day, you will disown me three times&rdquo;;</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.22.62"><span class="verse-num">62&nbsp;</span>and he went outside and wept bitterly.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.22.63"><span class="verse-num">63&nbsp;</span>The men that held Jesus kept making sport of him and beating him.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.22.64"><span class="verse-num">64&nbsp;</span>They blindfolded him and then questioned him. &ldquo;Now play the Prophet,&rdquo; they said; &ldquo;who was it that struck you?&rdquo;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.22.65"><span class="verse-num">65&nbsp;</span>And they heaped many other insults on him.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.22.66"><span class="verse-num">66&nbsp;</span>At daybreak the National Council met &mdash; both the Chief Priests and the Teachers of the Law &mdash; and took Jesus before their High Council.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.22.67"><span class="verse-num">67&nbsp;</span>&ldquo;If you are the Christ,&rdquo; they said, &ldquo;tell us so.&rdquo; <span class="woc"> &ldquo;If I tell you,&rdquo;</span>  replied Jesus, <span class="woc"> &ldquo;you will not believe me;</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.22.68"><span class="verse-num">68&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> and, if I question you, you will not answer.</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.22.69"><span class="verse-num">69&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> But from this hour &lsquo;the Son of Man will be seated on the right hand of God Almighty.&rsquo;&rdquo;</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.22.70"><span class="verse-num">70&nbsp;</span>&ldquo;Are you, then, the Son of God?&rdquo; they all asked. <span class="woc"> &ldquo;It is true,&rdquo;</span>  answered Jesus, <span class="woc"> &ldquo;I am.&rdquo;</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.22.71"><span class="verse-num">71&nbsp;</span>At this they exclaimed: &ldquo;Why do we want any more evidence? We have heard it ourselves from his own lips!&rdquo;</span>
