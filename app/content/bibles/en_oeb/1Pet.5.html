<span class="verse" data-osis="1Pet.5.1"><span class="verse-num verse-1">1&nbsp;</span>As for the older men among you, who bear office in the Church, I, their fellow-Officer, and a witness to the sufferings of the Christ, who shall also share in the glory that is to be revealed &mdash;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="1Pet.5.2"><span class="verse-num">2&nbsp;</span>I urge you to be true shepherds of the flock of God among you, not because you are compelled, but of your own free will; not from a base love of gain, but with a ready spirit;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="1Pet.5.3"><span class="verse-num">3&nbsp;</span>not as lords of your charges, but as examples to your flock.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="1Pet.5.4"><span class="verse-num">4&nbsp;</span>Then, when the Chief Shepherd appears, you will win the crown of glory that never fades.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="1Pet.5.5"><span class="verse-num">5&nbsp;</span>Again, you younger men should show deference to the older. And all of you should put on the badge of humility in mutual service, for &lsquo;God is opposed to the proud, but gives his help to the humble.&rsquo;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="1Pet.5.6"><span class="verse-num">6&nbsp;</span>Humble yourselves, therefore, under the mighty hand of God, so that he may exalt you in his good time,</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="1Pet.5.7"><span class="verse-num">7&nbsp;</span>laying all your anxieties upon him, for he makes you his care.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="1Pet.5.8"><span class="verse-num">8&nbsp;</span>Exercise self-control, be watchful. Your adversary, the Devil, like a roaring lion, is prowling about, eager to devour you.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="1Pet.5.9"><span class="verse-num">9&nbsp;</span>Stand firm against him, strong in your faith; knowing, as you do, that the very sufferings which you are undergoing are being endured to the full by your Brotherhood throughout the world.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="1Pet.5.10"><span class="verse-num">10&nbsp;</span>God, from whom all help comes, and who called you, by your union with Christ, into his eternal glory, will, when you have suffered for a little while, himself perfect, establish, strengthen you.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="1Pet.5.11"><span class="verse-num">11&nbsp;</span>To him be ascribed dominion for ever. Amen.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="1Pet.5.12"><span class="verse-num">12&nbsp;</span>I have been writing to you briefly by the hand of Silas, our true-hearted Brother (for so I regard him), to urge upon you, and to bear my testimony, that in what I have written is to be found the true love of God. On that take your stand.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="1Pet.5.13"><span class="verse-num">13&nbsp;</span>Your sister-Church in &lsquo;Babylon&rsquo; sends you greeting, and so does Mark, who is as a son to me.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="1Pet.5.14"><span class="verse-num">14&nbsp;</span>Greet one another with the kiss of love. May God give his peace to you all in your union with Christ.</span>
