<span class="verse" data-osis="Acts.26.1"><span class="verse-num verse-1">1&nbsp;</span>Turning to Paul, Agrippa said: &ldquo;You are at liberty to speak for yourself.&rdquo; Then Paul stretched out his hand and began his defence.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Acts.26.2"><span class="verse-num">2&nbsp;</span>&ldquo;I have been congratulating myself, King Agrippa,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that it is before you that I have to make my defence to-day, with regard to all the charges brought against me by Jews,</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Acts.26.3"><span class="verse-num">3&nbsp;</span>especially as you are so well-versed in all the customs and questions of the Jewish world. I beg you therefore to give me a patient hearing.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Acts.26.4"><span class="verse-num">4&nbsp;</span>My life, then, from youth upwards, was passed, from the very first, among my own nation, and in Jerusalem, and is within the knowledge of all Jews;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Acts.26.5"><span class="verse-num">5&nbsp;</span>and they have always known &mdash; if they choose to give evidence- -that, in accordance with the very strictest form of our religion, I lived a true Pharisee.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Acts.26.6"><span class="verse-num">6&nbsp;</span>Even now, it is because of my hope in the promise given by God to our ancestors that I stand here on my trial &mdash;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Acts.26.7"><span class="verse-num">7&nbsp;</span>A promise which our Twelve Tribes, by earnest service night and day, hope to see fulfilled. It is for this hope, your Majesty, that I am accused &mdash; and by Jews themselves!</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Acts.26.8"><span class="verse-num">8&nbsp;</span>Why do you all hold it incredible that God should raise the dead?</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Acts.26.9"><span class="verse-num">9&nbsp;</span>I myself, it is true, once thought it my duty to oppose in every way the Name of Jesus of Nazareth;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Acts.26.10"><span class="verse-num">10&nbsp;</span>and I actually did so at Jerusalem. Acting on the authority of the Chief Priests, I myself threw many of the People of Christ into prison, and, when it was proposed to put them to death, I gave my vote for it.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Acts.26.11"><span class="verse-num">11&nbsp;</span>Time after time, in every Synagogue, I tried by punishments to force them to blaspheme. So frantic was I against them, that I pursued them even to towns beyond our borders.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Acts.26.12"><span class="verse-num">12&nbsp;</span>It was while I was traveling to Damascus on an errand of this kind, entrusted with full powers by the Chief Priests,</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Acts.26.13"><span class="verse-num">13&nbsp;</span>that at mid-day, your Majesty, I saw right in my path, coming from the heavens, a light brighter than the glare of the sun, which shone all round me and those traveling with me.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Acts.26.14"><span class="verse-num">14&nbsp;</span>We all fell to the ground, and then I heard a voice saying to me in Hebrew &mdash; <span class="woc"> &lsquo;Saul, Saul, why are you persecuting me? By kicking against the goad you are punishing yourself.&rsquo;</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Acts.26.15"><span class="verse-num">15&nbsp;</span>&lsquo;Who are you, Lord?&rsquo; I asked. And the Lord said: <span class="woc"> &ldquo;I am Jesus, whom you are persecuting;</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Acts.26.16"><span class="verse-num">16&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> but get up and stand upright; for I have appeared to you in order to appoint you a servant and a witness of those revelations of me which you have already had, and of those in which I shall yet appear to you,</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Acts.26.17"><span class="verse-num">17&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> since I am choosing you out from your own people and from the Gentiles, to whom I now send you,</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Acts.26.18"><span class="verse-num">18&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> to open their eyes, and to turn them from darkness to light, and from the power of Satan to God; so that they may receive pardon for their sins, and a place among those who have become God&rsquo;s People, by faith in me.&rsquo;</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Acts.26.19"><span class="verse-num">19&nbsp;</span>After that, King Agrippa, I did not fail to obey the heavenly vision;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Acts.26.20"><span class="verse-num">20&nbsp;</span>on the contrary, first to those at Damascus and Jerusalem, and then through the whole of Judea, and to the Gentiles as well, I began to preach repentance and conversion to God, and a life befitting that repentance.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Acts.26.21"><span class="verse-num">21&nbsp;</span>This is why the Jews seized me in the Temple, and made attempts upon my life.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Acts.26.22"><span class="verse-num">22&nbsp;</span>However I have received help from God to this very day, and so stand here, and bear my testimony to high and low alike &mdash; without adding a word to what the Prophets, as well as Moses, declared should happen &mdash;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Acts.26.23"><span class="verse-num">23&nbsp;</span>That the Christ must suffer, and that, by rising from the dead, he was destined to be the first to bring news of Light, not only to our nation, but also to the Gentiles.&rdquo;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Acts.26.24"><span class="verse-num">24&nbsp;</span>While Paul was making this defence, Festus called out loudly: &ldquo;You are mad, Paul; your great learning is driving you mad.&rdquo;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Acts.26.25"><span class="verse-num">25&nbsp;</span>&ldquo;I am not mad, your Excellency,&rdquo; he replied; &ldquo;on the contrary, the statements that I am making are true and sober.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Acts.26.26"><span class="verse-num">26&nbsp;</span>Indeed, the King knows about these matters, so I speak before him without constraint. I am sure that there is nothing whatever of what I have been telling him that has escaped his attention; for all this has not been done in a corner.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Acts.26.27"><span class="verse-num">27&nbsp;</span>King Agrippa, do you believe the Prophets? I know you do.&rdquo;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Acts.26.28"><span class="verse-num">28&nbsp;</span>But Agrippa said to Paul: &ldquo;You are soon trying to make a Christian of me!&rdquo;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Acts.26.29"><span class="verse-num">29&nbsp;</span>&ldquo;Whether it is soon or late,&rdquo; answered Paul, &ldquo;I would to God that not only you, but all who are listening to me, might to-day become just what I am myself &mdash; except for these chains!&rdquo;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Acts.26.30"><span class="verse-num">30&nbsp;</span>Then the King rose, with the Governor and Bernice and those who had been sitting with them,</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Acts.26.31"><span class="verse-num">31&nbsp;</span>and, after retiring, discussed the case among themselves. &ldquo;There is nothing,&rdquo; they said, &ldquo;deserving death or imprisonment in this man&rsquo;s conduct&rdquo;;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Acts.26.32"><span class="verse-num">32&nbsp;</span>and, speaking to Festus, Agrippa added: &ldquo;The man might have been discharged, if he had not appealed to the Emperor.&rdquo;</span>
