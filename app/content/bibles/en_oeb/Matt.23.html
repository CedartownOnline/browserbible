<span class="verse Matt_23_3" data-osis="Matt.23.3"><span class="verse-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> Therefore practice and lay to heart everything that they tell preach but do not practice.</span></span>
<span class="verse Matt_23_4" data-osis="Matt.23.4"><span class="verse-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> While they make up heavy loads and pile them on other men&rsquo;s shoulder&rsquo;s they decline, themselves, to lift a finger to move them.</span></span>
<span class="verse Matt_23_5" data-osis="Matt.23.5"><span class="verse-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> All their actions are done to attract attention. They widen their phylacteries, and increase the size of their tassels,</span></span>
<span class="verse Matt_23_6" data-osis="Matt.23.6"><span class="verse-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> and like to have the place of honour at dinner, and the best seats in the Synagogues,</span></span>
<span class="verse Matt_23_7" data-osis="Matt.23.7"><span class="verse-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> and to be greeted in the markets with respect, and to be called &lsquo;Rabbi&rsquo; for everybody.</span></span>
<span class="verse Matt_23_8" data-osis="Matt.23.8"><span class="verse-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> But do not allow yourselves to be called &lsquo;Rabbi,&rsquo; for you have only one Teacher, and you yourselves are all Brothers.</span></span>
<span class="verse Matt_23_9" data-osis="Matt.23.9"><span class="verse-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> And do not call any one on the earth your &lsquo;Father,&rsquo; for your have only one Father, the heavenly Father.</span></span>
<span class="verse Matt_23_10" data-osis="Matt.23.10"><span class="verse-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> Nor must you allow yourselves to be called &lsquo;Leaders,&rsquo; for you have only one Leader, the Christ.</span></span>
<span class="verse Matt_23_11" data-osis="Matt.23.11"><span class="verse-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> The man who would be the greatest among you must be your servant.</span></span>

<span class="verse Matt_23_13" data-osis="Matt.23.13"><span class="verse-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> But alas for you, Teachers of the Law and Pharisees, hypocrites that you are! You turn the key of the Kingdom of Heaven in men&rsquo;s faces. For you do not go in yourselves, nor yet allow those who try to go in to do so.</span></span>
<span class="verse Matt_23_14" data-osis="Matt.23.14"><span class="verse-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> Alas for you, Teachers of the Law and Pharisees, hypocrites that you are!

<span class="verse Matt_23_16" data-osis="Matt.23.16"><span class="verse-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> Alas for you, you blind guides! You say &lsquo;if any answer by the Temple, his oath counts for nothing; but, if any one swears by the gold of the Temple, his oath is binding him&rsquo;!</span></span>
<span class="verse Matt_23_17" data-osis="Matt.23.17"><span class="verse-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> Fools that you are and blind! Which is the more important? The gold? Or the Temple which has given sacredness to the gold?</span></span>
<span class="verse Matt_23_18" data-osis="Matt.23.18"><span class="verse-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> You say, too, &lsquo;If any one swears by the altar, his oath counts for nothing, but, if any one swears by the offering placed on it, his oath is binding on him&rsquo;!</span></span>
<span class="verse Matt_23_19" data-osis="Matt.23.19"><span class="verse-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> Blind indeed! Which is the more important? The offering? or the altar which gives sacredness to the offering?</span></span>
<span class="verse Matt_23_20" data-osis="Matt.23.20"><span class="verse-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> Therefore a man, swearing by the altar, swears by it and by all that is on it,</span></span>
<span class="verse Matt_23_21" data-osis="Matt.23.21"><span class="verse-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> and a man, swearing by the Temple, swears by it and by him who dwells in it,</span></span>
<span class="verse Matt_23_22" data-osis="Matt.23.22"><span class="verse-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> while a man, swearing by Heaven, swears by the throne of God, and by him who sits upon it.</span></span>
<span class="verse Matt_23_23" data-osis="Matt.23.23"><span class="verse-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> Alas for you, Teachers of the Law and Pharisees, hypocrites that you are! You pay tithes on mint, fennel, and caraway seed, and have neglected the weightier matters of the Law &mdash; justice, mercy, and good faith. These last you ought to have put into practice, without neglecting the first.</span></span>
<span class="verse Matt_23_24" data-osis="Matt.23.24"><span class="verse-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> You blind guides, to strain out a gnat and to swallow a camel!</span></span>
<span class="verse Matt_23_25" data-osis="Matt.23.25"><span class="verse-num v-25">25&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> Alas for you, Teachers of the Law and Pharisees, hypocrites that you are! You clean the outside of the cup and the dish, but inside they are filled with the results of greed and self-indulgence.</span></span>
<span class="verse Matt_23_26" data-osis="Matt.23.26"><span class="verse-num v-26">26&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> You blind Pharisee! First clean the inside of the cup and the dish, so that the outside may become clean as well.</span></span>
<span class="verse Matt_23_27" data-osis="Matt.23.27"><span class="verse-num v-27">27&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> Alas for you, Teachers of the Law and Pharisees, hypocrites that you are! You are like whitewashed tombs, which indeed look fair outside, while inside they are filled with dead men&rsquo;s bones and all kinds of filth.</span></span>
<span class="verse Matt_23_28" data-osis="Matt.23.28"><span class="verse-num v-28">28&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> It is the same with you. Outwardly, and to others, you have the look of religious men, but inwardly you are full of hypocrisy and sin.</span></span>
<span class="verse Matt_23_29" data-osis="Matt.23.29"><span class="verse-num v-29">29&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> Alas for you, Teachers of the Law and Pharisees, hypocrites that you are! You build the tombs of the Prophets, and decorate the monuments of religious men,</span></span>
<span class="verse Matt_23_30" data-osis="Matt.23.30"><span class="verse-num v-30">30&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> and say &lsquo;Had we been living in the days of our ancestors, we should have taken part in their murder of the Prophets!</span></span>
<span class="verse Matt_23_31" data-osis="Matt.23.31"><span class="verse-num v-31">31&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> By doing this you are furnishing evidence against yourselves that you are true children of the men who murdered the Prophets.</span></span>
<span class="verse Matt_23_32" data-osis="Matt.23.32"><span class="verse-num v-32">32&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> Fill up the measure of your ancestor&rsquo;s guilt.</span></span>
<span class="verse Matt_23_33" data-osis="Matt.23.33"><span class="verse-num v-33">33&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> You serpents and brood of vipers! How can you escape being sentenced to the Pit?</span></span>
<span class="verse Matt_23_34" data-osis="Matt.23.34"><span class="verse-num v-34">34&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> That is why I send you Prophets, wise men, and Teachers of the Law, some of whom you will crucify and kill, and some of whom you will scourge in your Synagogues, and persecute from town to town;</span></span>
<span class="verse Matt_23_35" data-osis="Matt.23.35"><span class="verse-num v-35">35&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> in order that upon your heads may fall every drop of innocent &lsquo;blood split on earth,&rsquo; from the blood of innocent Abel down to that of Zechariah, Barachiah&rsquo;s son, whom you murdered between the Temple and the altar.</span></span>
<span class="verse Matt_23_36" data-osis="Matt.23.36"><span class="verse-num v-36">36&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> All this, I tell you, will come home to the present generation.</span></span>
<span class="verse Matt_23_37" data-osis="Matt.23.37"><span class="verse-num v-37">37&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> Jerusalem! Jerusalem! She who slays the Prophets and stones the messengers sent to her &mdash; Oh, how often have I wished to gather your children round me, as a hen gathers her brood under her wings, and you would not came!</span></span>
<span class="verse Matt_23_38" data-osis="Matt.23.38"><span class="verse-num v-38">38&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> Verily, your house is left to you desolate!</span></span>
<span class="verse Matt_23_39" data-osis="Matt.23.39"><span class="verse-num v-39">39&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> For nevermore, I tell you, shall you see me, until you say &mdash;  &lsquo;Blessed is He who comes in the Name of the Lord!&rsquo;&rdquo; </span></span>
