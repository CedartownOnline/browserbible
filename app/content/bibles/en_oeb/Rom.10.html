<h2 class="chapter-num">10</h2>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="Rom.10.1"><span class="verse-num verse-1">1&nbsp;</span>Brothers, my heart&rsquo;s desire and prayer to God for my People is for their Salvation.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Rom.10.2"><span class="verse-num">2&nbsp;</span>I can testify that they are zealous for the honour of God; but they are not guided by true insight,</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Rom.10.3"><span class="verse-num">3&nbsp;</span>for, in their ignorance of the Divine Righteousness, and in their eagerness to set up a righteousness of their own, they refused to accept with submission the Divine Righteousness.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Rom.10.4"><span class="verse-num">4&nbsp;</span>For Christ has brought Law to an end, so that righteousness may be obtained by every one who believes in him.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Rom.10.5"><span class="verse-num">5&nbsp;</span>For Moses writes that, as for the righteousness which results from Law, &lsquo;those who practice it will find Life through it.&rsquo;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Rom.10.6"><span class="verse-num">6&nbsp;</span>But the righteousness which results from faith finds expression in these words &mdash; &lsquo;Do not say to yourself &ldquo;Who will go up into heaven?&rdquo;&rsquo; &mdash; which means to bring Christ down &mdash; &lsquo;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Rom.10.7"><span class="verse-num">7&nbsp;</span>or &ldquo;Who will go down into the depths below?&rdquo;&rsquo; &mdash; which means to bring Christ up from the dead.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Rom.10.8"><span class="verse-num">8&nbsp;</span>No, but what does it say? &lsquo;The Message of Faith&rsquo; which we proclaim.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Rom.10.9"><span class="verse-num">9&nbsp;</span>For, if with your lips you acknowledge the truth of the Message that JESUS IS LORD, and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you shall be saved.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Rom.10.10"><span class="verse-num">10&nbsp;</span>For with their hearts men believe and so attain to righteousness, while with their lips they make their Profession of Faith and so find Salvation.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Rom.10.11"><span class="verse-num">11&nbsp;</span>As the passage of Scripture says &mdash; &lsquo;No one who believes in him shall have any cause for shame.&rsquo;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Rom.10.12"><span class="verse-num">12&nbsp;</span>For no distinction is made between the Jew and the Greek, for all have the same Lord, and he is bountiful to all who invoke him.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Rom.10.13"><span class="verse-num">13&nbsp;</span>For &lsquo;every one who invokes the Name of the Lord shall be saved.&rsquo;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Rom.10.14"><span class="verse-num">14&nbsp;</span>But how, it may be asked, are they to invoke one in whom they have not learned to believe? And how are they to believe in one whose words they have not heard? And how are they to hear his words unless some one proclaims him?</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Rom.10.15"><span class="verse-num">15&nbsp;</span>And how are men to proclaim him unless they are sent as his messengers? As Scripture says &mdash; &lsquo;How beautiful are the feet of those who bring good news!&rsquo;</span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="Rom.10.16"><span class="verse-num">16&nbsp;</span>Still, it may be said, every one did not give heed to the Good News. No, for Isaiah asks &mdash; &lsquo;Lord, who has believed our teaching?&rsquo;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Rom.10.17"><span class="verse-num">17&nbsp;</span>And so we gather, faith is a result of teaching, and the teaching comes in the Message of Christ.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Rom.10.18"><span class="verse-num">18&nbsp;</span>But I ask &lsquo;Is it possible that men have never heard?&rsquo; No, indeed, for &mdash; &lsquo;Their voices spread through all the earth, and their Message to the very ends of the world.&rsquo;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Rom.10.19"><span class="verse-num">19&nbsp;</span>But again I ask &lsquo;Did not the people of Israel understand? First there is Moses, who says &mdash; &lsquo;I, the Lord, will stir you to rivalry with a nation which is no nation; Against an undiscerning nation I will arouse your anger.&rsquo;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Rom.10.20"><span class="verse-num">20&nbsp;</span>And Isaiah says boldly &mdash; &lsquo;I was found by those who were not seeking me; I made myself known to those who were not inquiring of me.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Rom.10.21"><span class="verse-num">21&nbsp;</span>But of the people of Israel he says &mdash; &lsquo;All day long I have stretched out my hands to a people who disobey and contradict.&rsquo;</span>
