<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.24.1"><span class="verse-num verse-1">1&nbsp;</span>Leaving the Temple Courts, Jesus was walking away, when his disciples came up to draw his attention to the Temple buildings.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.24.2"><span class="verse-num">2&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> &ldquo;Do you see all these things?&rdquo; </span>  was his answer. <span class="woc"> &ldquo;I tell you, not a single stone will be left here upon another, which will not be throne down,&rdquo; </span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.24.3"><span class="verse-num">3&nbsp;</span>so, while Jesus was sitting on the Mount of Olives, his disciples came up to him privately and said: &ldquo;Tell us when this will be, and what will be the sign of your Coming, and of the close of the age.&rdquo;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.24.4"><span class="verse-num">4&nbsp;</span>Jesus replied to them as follows: <span class="woc"> &ldquo;See that no one leads you astray;</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.24.5"><span class="verse-num">5&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> for, many will take my name, and come saying &lsquo;I am the Christ,&rsquo; and will lead many astray.</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.24.6"><span class="verse-num">6&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> And you will hear of wars and rumours of wars; take care not to be alarmed, for such things must occur; but the end is not yet here.</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.24.7"><span class="verse-num">7&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> For &lsquo;nation will rise against nation and kingdom against kingdom,&rsquo; and there will be famines and earthquakes in various places.</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.24.8"><span class="verse-num">8&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> All this, however, will be but the beginning of the birth pangs!</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.24.9"><span class="verse-num">9&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> When that time comes, they will give you up to persecution, and will put you to death, and you will be hated by all nations on account of my Name.</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.24.10"><span class="verse-num">10&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> And then many will fall away, and will betray one another, and hate one another.</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.24.11"><span class="verse-num">11&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> Many false Prophets, also, will appear and lead many astray;</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.24.12"><span class="verse-num">12&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> and, owing to the increase of wickedness, the love of most will grow cold.</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.24.13"><span class="verse-num">13&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> Yet the man that endures to the end shall be saved.</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.24.14"><span class="verse-num">14&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> And this Good News of the Kingdom shall be proclaimed throughout the world as a witness to all nations; and then will come the end.</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.24.15"><span class="verse-num">15&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> As soon, then, as you see &lsquo;the Foul Desecration,&rsquo; mentioned by the Prophet Daniel, standing in the Holy Place,&rdquo; </span>  (the reader must consider what this means)</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.24.16"><span class="verse-num">16&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> &ldquo;then those of you who are in Judea must take refuge in the mountains;</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.24.17"><span class="verse-num">17&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> and a man on the housetop must not go down to get the things that are in his house;</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.24.18"><span class="verse-num">18&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> nor must one who is on his farm turn back to get his cloak.</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.24.19"><span class="verse-num">19&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> And alas for the women that are with child, and for those that are nursing infants in those days!</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.24.20"><span class="verse-num">20&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> Pray, too, that your flight may not take place in winter, nor on a Sabbath;</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.24.21"><span class="verse-num">21&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> for that will be &lsquo;a time of great distress, the like of which has not occurred from the beginning of the world down to the present time&rsquo; &mdash; no, nor ever will again.</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.24.22"><span class="verse-num">22&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> And had not those days been limited, not a single soul would escape; but for the sake of &lsquo;God&rsquo;s People&rsquo; a limit will be put to them.</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.24.23"><span class="verse-num">23&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> And, at that time, if any one should say to you &lsquo;Look! here is the Christ!&rsquo; or &lsquo;Here he is!&rsquo;, do not believe it;</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.24.24"><span class="verse-num">24&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> for false Christs and false Prophets will arise, and will display great signs and marvels, so that, were it possible, even God&rsquo;s People would be led astray.</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.24.25"><span class="verse-num">25&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> Remember, I have told you beforehand.</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.24.26"><span class="verse-num">26&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> Therefore, if people say to you &lsquo;He is in the Wilderness!&rsquo;, do not go out there; or &lsquo;He is in an inner room!&rsquo;, do not believe it;</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.24.27"><span class="verse-num">27&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> for, just as lightning will start from the east and flash across to the west, so will it be with the Coming of the Son of Man.</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.24.28"><span class="verse-num">28&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> Wherever a dead body lies, there will the vultures flock.&rsquo;</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.24.29"><span class="verse-num">29&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> Immediately after the distress of those days, &lsquo;the sun will be darkened, the moon will not give her light, the stars will fall from the heavens,&rsquo; and &lsquo;the forces of the heavens will be convulsed.&rsquo;</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.24.30"><span class="verse-num">30&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> Then will appear the sign of the Son of Man in the heavens; and all the peoples of the earth will mourn, when they see the Son of Man coming on the clouds of the heavens,&rsquo; with power and great glory;</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.24.31"><span class="verse-num">31&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> and he will send his angels, with a great trumpet, and they will gather his People round him from the four winds, from one end of heaven to the other.</span></span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.24.32"><span class="verse-num">32&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> Learn the lesson taught by the fig tree. As soon as its branches are full of sap, and it is bursting into leaf, you know that summer is near.</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.24.33"><span class="verse-num">33&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> And so may you, as soon as you see all these things, know that he is at your doors.</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.24.34"><span class="verse-num">34&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> I tell you, even the present generation will not pass away, till all these things have taken place.</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.24.35"><span class="verse-num">35&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> The heavens and the earth will pass away, but my words shall never pass away.</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.24.36"><span class="verse-num">36&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> But about that Day and Hour, no one knows &mdash; not even the angels of Heaven, nor yet the Son &mdash; but only the Father himself.</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.24.37"><span class="verse-num">37&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> For, just as in the days of Noah, so will it be at the Coming of the Son of Man.</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.24.38"><span class="verse-num">38&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> In those days before the flood they went on eating and drinking, marrying and being married, up to the very day on which Noah entered the ark,</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.24.39"><span class="verse-num">39&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> taking not notice till the flood came and swept them one and all away; and so will it be at the Coming of the Son of Man.</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.24.40"><span class="verse-num">40&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> At that time, of two men on a farm one will be taken and one left;</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.24.41"><span class="verse-num">41&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> of two women grinding with the hand-mill one will be taken and one left.</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.24.42"><span class="verse-num">42&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> Therefore watch; for you cannot be sure on what day your Master is coming.</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.24.43"><span class="verse-num">43&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> But this you do know, that, had the owner of the house known at what time of night the thief was coming, he would have been on the watch, and would not have allowed his house to be broken into.</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.24.44"><span class="verse-num">44&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> Therefore, do you also prepare, since it is just when you are least expecting him that the Son of Man will come.</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.24.45"><span class="verse-num">45&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> Who, then is that trustworthy, careful servant, who has been placed by his master over his household, to give them their food at the proper time?</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.24.46"><span class="verse-num">46&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> Happy will that servant be whom his master, when he comes home, shall find doing this.</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.24.47"><span class="verse-num">47&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> I tell you that his master will put him in charge of the whole of his property.</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.24.48"><span class="verse-num">48&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> But, should he be a bad servant, and say to himself &lsquo;My master is a long time in coming,&rsquo;</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.24.49"><span class="verse-num">49&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> and begin to beat his fellow-servants, and eat and drink with drunkards,</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.24.50"><span class="verse-num">50&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> that servant&rsquo;s master will come on a day when he does not expect him, and at an hour of which he is unaware,</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.24.51"><span class="verse-num">51&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> and will flog him severely, and assign him his place among the hypocrites, where there will be weeping and grinding of teeth.</span></span>
