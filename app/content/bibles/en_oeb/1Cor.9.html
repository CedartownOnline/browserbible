<h2 class="chapter-num">9</h2>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="1Cor.9.1"><span class="verse-num verse-1">1&nbsp;</span>Am I not free? Am I not an Apostle? Have I not seen our Lord Jesus? Are not you yourselves my work achieved in union with the Lord?</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="1Cor.9.2"><span class="verse-num">2&nbsp;</span>If I am not an Apostle to others, yet at least I am to you; for you are the seal that stamps me as an Apostle in union with the Lord.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="1Cor.9.3"><span class="verse-num">3&nbsp;</span>The defence that I make to my critics is this:</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="1Cor.9.4"><span class="verse-num">4&nbsp;</span>Have not we a right to food and drink?</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="1Cor.9.5"><span class="verse-num">5&nbsp;</span>Have not we a right to take a wife with us, if she is a Christian, as the other Apostles and the Master&rsquo;s brothers and Kephas all do?</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="1Cor.9.6"><span class="verse-num">6&nbsp;</span>Or is it only Barnabas and I who have no right to give up working for our bread?</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="1Cor.9.7"><span class="verse-num">7&nbsp;</span>Does any one ever serve as a soldier at his own expense? Does any one plant a vineyard and not eat its produce? Or does any one look after a herd and not drink the milk?</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="1Cor.9.8"><span class="verse-num">8&nbsp;</span>Am I, in all this, speaking only from the human standpoint? Does not the Law also say the same?</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="1Cor.9.9"><span class="verse-num">9&nbsp;</span>For in the Law of Moses it is said-&rsquo;Thou shalt not muzzle a bullock while it is treading out the grain.&rsquo; Is it the bullocks that God is thinking of?</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="1Cor.9.10"><span class="verse-num">10&nbsp;</span>Or is not is said entirely for our sakes? Surely it was written for our sakes, for the ploughman ought not to plough, nor the thrasher to thrash, without expecting a share of the grain.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="1Cor.9.11"><span class="verse-num">11&nbsp;</span>Since we, then, sowed spiritual seed for you, is it too much that we should reap from you an earthly harvest?</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="1Cor.9.12"><span class="verse-num">12&nbsp;</span>If others share in this right over you, do not we even more? Still we did not avail ourselves of this right. No, we endure anything rather than impede the progress of the Good News of the Christ.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="1Cor.9.13"><span class="verse-num">13&nbsp;</span>Do not you know that those who do the work of the Temple live on what comes from the Temple, and that those who serve at the altar share the offerings with the altar?</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="1Cor.9.14"><span class="verse-num">14&nbsp;</span>So, too, the Master has appointed that those who tell the Good News should get their living from the Good News.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="1Cor.9.15"><span class="verse-num">15&nbsp;</span>I, however, have not availed myself of any of these rights. I am not saying this to secure such an arrangement for myself; indeed, I would far rather die-Nobody shall make my boast a vain one!</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="1Cor.9.16"><span class="verse-num">16&nbsp;</span>If I tell the Good News, I have nothing to boast of, for I can but do so. Woe is me if I do not tell it!</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="1Cor.9.17"><span class="verse-num">17&nbsp;</span>If I do this work willingly, I have a reward; but, if unwillingly, I have been charged to perform a duty.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="1Cor.9.18"><span class="verse-num">18&nbsp;</span>What is my reward, then? To present the Good News free of all cost, and so make but a sparing use of the rights which it gives me.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="1Cor.9.19"><span class="verse-num">19&nbsp;</span>Although I was entirely free, yet, to win as many converts as possible, I made myself everyone&rsquo;s slave.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="1Cor.9.20"><span class="verse-num">20&nbsp;</span>To the Jews I became like a Jew, to win Jews. To those who are subject to Law I became like a man subject to Law-though I was not myself subject to Law-to win those who are subject to Law.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="1Cor.9.21"><span class="verse-num">21&nbsp;</span>To those who have no Law I became like a man who has no Law- -not that I am free from God&rsquo;s Law; no, for I am under Christ&rsquo;s Law-to win those who have no law.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="1Cor.9.22"><span class="verse-num">22&nbsp;</span>To the weak I became weak, to win the weak. I have become all things to all men, so as at all costs to save some.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="1Cor.9.23"><span class="verse-num">23&nbsp;</span>And I do everything for the sake of the Good News, that with them I may share in its blessings.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="1Cor.9.24"><span class="verse-num">24&nbsp;</span>Do not you know that on a race-course, though all run, yet only one wins the prize? Run in such a way that you may win.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="1Cor.9.25"><span class="verse-num">25&nbsp;</span>Every athlete exercises self-restraint in everything; they, indeed, for a crown that fades, we for one that is unfading.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="1Cor.9.26"><span class="verse-num">26&nbsp;</span>I, therefore, run with no uncertain aim. I box-not like a man hitting the air.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="1Cor.9.27"><span class="verse-num">27&nbsp;</span>No, I bruise my body and make it my slave, lest I, who have called others to the contest, should myself be rejected.</span>
