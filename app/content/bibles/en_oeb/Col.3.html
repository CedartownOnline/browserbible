<span class="verse" data-osis="Col.3.1"><span class="verse-num verse-1">1&nbsp;</span>Since, therefore, you were raised to Life with the Christ, seek for the things that are above; for it is there that the Christ is &lsquo;seated at the right hand of God.&rsquo;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Col.3.2"><span class="verse-num">2&nbsp;</span>Fix your thoughts upon the things that are above, not upon those that are on earth.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Col.3.3"><span class="verse-num">3&nbsp;</span>For you died, and your Life now lies hidden, with the Christ, in God.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Col.3.4"><span class="verse-num">4&nbsp;</span>When the Christ, who is our Life, appears, then you also will appear with him in glory.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Col.3.5"><span class="verse-num">5&nbsp;</span>Therefore destroy all that is earthly in you &mdash; immorality, uncleanness, passions, evil desires, and that greed which is idolatry.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Col.3.6"><span class="verse-num">6&nbsp;</span>These are the things on account of which the Wrath of God comes,</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Col.3.7"><span class="verse-num">7&nbsp;</span>and to which you, like others, once devoted your lives, when you lived for them.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Col.3.8"><span class="verse-num">8&nbsp;</span>You, however, must now lay aside all such things &mdash; anger, passion, malice, slander, abuse.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Col.3.9"><span class="verse-num">9&nbsp;</span>Never lie to one another. Get rid of your old self and its habits,</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Col.3.10"><span class="verse-num">10&nbsp;</span>and clothe yourselves with that new self, which, as it gains in knowledge, is being constantly renewed &lsquo;in resemblance to him who made it.&rsquo;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Col.3.11"><span class="verse-num">11&nbsp;</span>In that new life there is no distinction between Greek and Jew, circumcised and uncircumcised, barbarian, Scythian, slave, freeman; but Christ is all! &mdash; and in all!</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Col.3.12"><span class="verse-num">12&nbsp;</span>Therefore, as God&rsquo;s People, consecrated and dear to him, clothe yourselves with tenderness of heart, kindliness, humility, gentleness, forbearance;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Col.3.13"><span class="verse-num">13&nbsp;</span>bearing with one another, and, when there is any ground for complaint, forgiving one another freely. As the Master freely forgave you, so you must forgive one another.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Col.3.14"><span class="verse-num">14&nbsp;</span>Over all these virtues put on love; for that is the girdle which makes all complete.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Col.3.15"><span class="verse-num">15&nbsp;</span>Let the Peace that the Christ gives decide all doubts within your hearts; for you also were called to the enjoyment of peace as members of one Body. And show yourselves thankful.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Col.3.16"><span class="verse-num">16&nbsp;</span>Let the Message of the Christ dwell in your minds in all its wealth, bringing all wisdom with it. Teach and admonish one another with psalms, and hymns, and sacred songs, full of the loving- kindness of God, lifting your hearts in song to him.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Col.3.17"><span class="verse-num">17&nbsp;</span>And, whatever you say or do, do everything in the Name of the Lord Jesus; and through him offer thanksgiving to God the father.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Col.3.18"><span class="verse-num">18&nbsp;</span>Wives, submit to your husbands, as befits those who belong to the Lord.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Col.3.19"><span class="verse-num">19&nbsp;</span>Husbands, love your wives, and never treat them harshly.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Col.3.20"><span class="verse-num">20&nbsp;</span>Children, always obey your parents; for that is pleasant to see in those who belong to the Lord.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Col.3.21"><span class="verse-num">21&nbsp;</span>Fathers, never irritate your children, lest they should become disheartened.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Col.3.22"><span class="verse-num">22&nbsp;</span>Slaves, always obey your earthly masters, not only when their eyes are on you, as if you had but to please men, but giving them ungrudging service, in your reverence for the Master.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Col.3.23"><span class="verse-num">23&nbsp;</span>Whatever you do, do it with all your heart, as if working for the Master and not for men,</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Col.3.24"><span class="verse-num">24&nbsp;</span>since you know that it is from the Master that you will receive the inheritance which will be your recompense. You are serving Christ, the Master.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Col.3.25"><span class="verse-num">25&nbsp;</span>Those who do wrong will reap the wrong they have done; and there will be no partiality.</span>
