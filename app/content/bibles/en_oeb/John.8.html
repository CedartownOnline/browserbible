<span class="verse" data-osis="John.8.12"><span class="verse-num">12&nbsp;</span>Jesus again addressed the people. <span class="woc"> &ldquo;I am the Light of the World,&rdquo;</span>  he said. <span class="woc"> &ldquo;He who follows me shall not walk in darkness, but shall have the Light of Life.&rdquo;</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.8.13"><span class="verse-num">13&nbsp;</span>&ldquo;You are bearing testimony to yourself!&rdquo; exclaimed the Pharisees, &ldquo;your testimony is not trustworthy.&rdquo;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.8.14"><span class="verse-num">14&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> &ldquo;Even if I bear testimony to myself,&rdquo;</span>  answered Jesus, <span class="woc"> &ldquo;my testimony is trustworthy; for I know where I came from, and where I am going; but you do not know where I come from, nor where I am going.</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.8.15"><span class="verse-num">15&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> You judge by appearances; I judge no one.</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.8.16"><span class="verse-num">16&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> Yet, even if I were to judge, my judgment would be trustworthy; because I am not alone, but the Father who sent me is with me.</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.8.17"><span class="verse-num">17&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> Why, in your own Law it is said that the testimony of two persons is trustworthy.</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.8.18"><span class="verse-num">18&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> I, who bear testimony to myself, am one, and the Father who sent me also bears testimony to me.&rdquo;</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.8.19"><span class="verse-num">19&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> &ldquo;Where is your father, then?&rdquo;</span>  they asked. <span class="woc"> &ldquo;You know neither me nor my Father,&rdquo;</span>  replied Jesus. <span class="woc"> &ldquo;If you had known me, you would have also known my Father.&rdquo;</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.8.20"><span class="verse-num">20&nbsp;</span>These statements Jesus made in the Treasury, while teaching in the Temple Courts. Yet no one arrested him, for his time had not then come.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.8.21"><span class="verse-num">21&nbsp;</span>Jesus again spoke to the people. <span class="woc"> &ldquo;I am going away,&rdquo;</span>  he said, <span class="woc"> &ldquo;and you will look for me, but you will die in your sin; you cannot come where I am going.&rdquo;</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.8.22"><span class="verse-num">22&nbsp;</span>&ldquo;Is he going to kill himself,&rdquo; the Jews exclaimed, &ldquo;that he says &mdash; <span class="woc"> &lsquo;You cannot go where I am going&rsquo;?&rdquo;</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.8.23"><span class="verse-num">23&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> &ldquo;You,&rdquo;</span>  added Jesus, <span class="woc"> &ldquo;are from below, I am from above; you are of this present world, I am not;</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.8.24"><span class="verse-num">24&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> and so I told you that you would die in your sins, for, unless you believe that I am what I am, you will die in your sins.&rdquo;</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.8.25"><span class="verse-num">25&nbsp;</span>&ldquo;Who are you?&rdquo; they asked. <span class="woc"> &ldquo;Why ask exactly what I have been telling you?&rdquo;</span>  said Jesus.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.8.26"><span class="verse-num">26&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> &ldquo;I have still much that concerns you to speak of and to pass judgment on; yet he who sent me may be trusted, and I speak to the world only of the things which I have heard from him.&rdquo;</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.8.27"><span class="verse-num">27&nbsp;</span>They did not understand that he meant the Father.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.8.28"><span class="verse-num">28&nbsp;</span>So Jesus added: <span class="woc"> &ldquo;When you have lifted up the Son of Man, then you will understand that I am what I am, and that I do nothing of myself, but that I say just what the Father has taught me.</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.8.29"><span class="verse-num">29&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> Moreover, he who sent me is with me; he has not left me alone; for I always do what pleases him.&rdquo;</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.8.30"><span class="verse-num">30&nbsp;</span>While he was speaking in this way, many came to believe in him.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.8.31"><span class="verse-num">31&nbsp;</span>So Jesus went on to say to those Jews who had believed him: <span class="woc"> &ldquo;If you remain constant to my Message, you are truly my disciples;</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.8.32"><span class="verse-num">32&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> and you find out the Truth, and the Truth will set you free.&rdquo;</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.8.33"><span class="verse-num">33&nbsp;</span>&ldquo;We are descendants of Abraham,&rdquo; was their answer, &ldquo;and have never yet been in slavery to any one. What do you mean by saying <span class="woc"> &lsquo;you will be set free&rsquo;?&rdquo;</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.8.34"><span class="verse-num">34&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> &ldquo;In truth I tell you,&rdquo;</span>  replied Jesus, <span class="woc"> &ldquo;every one who sins is a slave to sin.</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.8.35"><span class="verse-num">35&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> And a slave does not remain in the home always; but a son remains always.</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.8.36"><span class="verse-num">36&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> If, then, the Son sets you free, you will be free indeed!</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.8.37"><span class="verse-num">37&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> I know that you are descendants of Abraham; yet you are seeking to put me to death, because my Message finds no place in your hearts.</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.8.38"><span class="verse-num">38&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> I tell you what I have myself seen in the presence of my Father; and you, in the same way, do what you have learned from your father.&rdquo;</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.8.39"><span class="verse-num">39&nbsp;</span>&ldquo;Our father is Abraham,&rdquo; was their answer. <span class="woc"> &ldquo;If you are Abraham&rsquo;s children,&rdquo;</span>  replied Jesus, <span class="woc"> &ldquo;do what Abraham did.</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.8.40"><span class="verse-num">40&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> But, as it is, you are seeking to put me to death &mdash; a man who has told you the Truth as he heard it from God. Abraham did not act in that way.</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.8.41"><span class="verse-num">41&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> You are doing what your own father does.&rdquo;</span>  &ldquo;We are not bastards,&rdquo; they said, &ldquo;we have one Father &mdash; God himself.&rdquo;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.8.42"><span class="verse-num">42&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> &ldquo;If God were your Father,&rdquo;</span>  Jesus replied, <span class="woc"> &ldquo;you would have loved me, for I came out from God, and now am here; and I have not come of myself, but he sent me as his Messenger.</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.8.43"><span class="verse-num">43&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> How is it that you do not understand what I say? It is because you cannot bear to listen to my Message.</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.8.44"><span class="verse-num">44&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> As for you, you are children of your Father the Devil, and you are determined to do what your father loves to do. He was a murderer from the first, and did not stand by the truth, because there is no truth in him. Whenever he lies, he does what is natural to him; because he is a liar, and the father of lying.</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.8.45"><span class="verse-num">45&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> But, as for me, it is because I speak the truth to you that you do not believe me.</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.8.46"><span class="verse-num">46&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> Which of you can convict me of sin? Why then do not you believe me, if I am speaking truth?</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.8.47"><span class="verse-num">47&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> He who comes from God listens to God&rsquo;s teaching; the reason why you do not listen is because you do not come from God.&rdquo;</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.8.48"><span class="verse-num">48&nbsp;</span>&ldquo;Are not we right, after all,&rdquo; replied the Jews, &ldquo;in saying that you are a Samaritan, and are possessed by a demon?&rdquo;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.8.49"><span class="verse-num">49&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> &ldquo;I am not possessed by a demon,&rdquo;</span>  Jesus answered, <span class="woc"> &ldquo;but I am showing reverence for my Father; and yet you have no reverence for me.</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.8.50"><span class="verse-num">50&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> Not that I am seeking honour for myself; there is one who is seeking my honour, and he decides.</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.8.51"><span class="verse-num">51&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> In truth I tell you, if any one lays my Message to heart, he will never really die.&rdquo;</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.8.52"><span class="verse-num">52&nbsp;</span>&ldquo;Now we are sure that you are possessed by a demon,&rdquo; the Jews replied. &ldquo;Abraham died, and so did the Prophets; and yet you say <span class="woc"> &lsquo;If any one lays my Message to heart, he will never know death.&rsquo;</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.8.53"><span class="verse-num">53&nbsp;</span>Are you greater than our ancestor Abraham, who died? And the Prophets died too. Whom do you make yourself out to be?&rdquo;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.8.54"><span class="verse-num">54&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> &ldquo;If I do honour to myself,&rdquo;</span>  answered Jesus, <span class="woc"> &ldquo;such honour counts for nothing. It is my Father who does me honour &mdash; and you say that he is your God;</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.8.55"><span class="verse-num">55&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> and yet you have not learned to know him; but I know him; and, if I were to say that I do not know him, I should be a liar like you; but I do know him, and I lay his Message to heart.</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.8.56"><span class="verse-num">56&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> Your ancestor Abraham rejoiced that he would see my day; and he did see it, and was glad.&rdquo;</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.8.57"><span class="verse-num">57&nbsp;</span>&ldquo;You are not fifty years old yet,&rdquo; the Jews exclaimed, &ldquo;and have you seen Abraham?&rdquo;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.8.58"><span class="verse-num">58&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> &ldquo;In truth I tell you,&rdquo;</span>  replied Jesus, <span class="woc"> &ldquo;before Abraham existed I was.&rdquo;</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.8.59"><span class="verse-num">59&nbsp;</span>At this they took up stones to throw at him; but Jesus hid himself, and left the Temple Courts.</span>
