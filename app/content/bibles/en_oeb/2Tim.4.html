<span class="verse" data-osis="2Tim.4.1"><span class="verse-num verse-1">1&nbsp;</span>I solemnly charge you, in the sight of God and of Christ Jesus, who will one day judge the living and the dead &mdash; I charge you by his Appearing and by his Kingdom: &mdash;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="2Tim.4.2"><span class="verse-num">2&nbsp;</span>Proclaim the Message, be ready in season and out of season, convince, rebuke, encourage, never failing to instruct with forbearance.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="2Tim.4.3"><span class="verse-num">3&nbsp;</span>For a time will come when people will not tolerate sound teaching. They will follow their own wishes, and, in their itching for novelty, procure themselves a crowd of teachers.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="2Tim.4.4"><span class="verse-num">4&nbsp;</span>They will turn a deaf ear to the Truth, and give their attention to legends instead.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="2Tim.4.5"><span class="verse-num">5&nbsp;</span>But you, Timothy, must always be temperate. Face hardships; do the work of a Missionary; discharge all the duties of your Office.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="2Tim.4.6"><span class="verse-num">6&nbsp;</span>As for me, my life blood is already being poured out; the time of my departure is close at hand.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="2Tim.4.7"><span class="verse-num">7&nbsp;</span>I have run the great Race; I have finished the Course; I have kept the Faith.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="2Tim.4.8"><span class="verse-num">8&nbsp;</span>And now the crown of righteousness awaits me, which the Lord, the just Judge, will give me on &lsquo;That Day&rsquo; &mdash; and not only to me, but to all who have loved his Appearing.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="2Tim.4.9"><span class="verse-num">9&nbsp;</span>Do your utmost to come to me soon;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="2Tim.4.10"><span class="verse-num">10&nbsp;</span>for Demas, in his love for the world, has deserted me. He has gone to Thessalonica, Crescens to Galatia, and Titus to Dalmatia.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="2Tim.4.11"><span class="verse-num">11&nbsp;</span>There is no one but Luke with me. Pick up Mark on your way, and bring him with you, for he is useful to me in my work.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="2Tim.4.12"><span class="verse-num">12&nbsp;</span>I have sent Tychicus to Ephesus.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="2Tim.4.13"><span class="verse-num">13&nbsp;</span>Bring with you, when you come, the cloak which I left at Troas with Carpus, and the books, especially the parchments.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="2Tim.4.14"><span class="verse-num">14&nbsp;</span>Alexander, the coppersmith, showed much ill-feeling towards me. &lsquo;The Lord will give him what his actions deserve.&rsquo;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="2Tim.4.15"><span class="verse-num">15&nbsp;</span>Do you also, be on your guard against him, for he is strongly opposed to our teaching.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="2Tim.4.16"><span class="verse-num">16&nbsp;</span>At my first trial no one stood by me. They all deserted me. May it never be counted against them!</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="2Tim.4.17"><span class="verse-num">17&nbsp;</span>But the Lord came to my help and strengthened me, in order that, through me, the proclamation should be made so widely that all the Gentiles should hear it; and I was rescued &lsquo;out of the Lion&rsquo;s mouth.&rsquo;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="2Tim.4.18"><span class="verse-num">18&nbsp;</span>The Lord will rescue me from all evil, and bring me safe into his Heavenly Kingdom. All glory to him for ever and ever! Amen.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="2Tim.4.19"><span class="verse-num">19&nbsp;</span>Give my greeting to Prisca and Aquila, and to the household of Onesiphorus.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="2Tim.4.20"><span class="verse-num">20&nbsp;</span>Erastus remained at Corinth, and I left Thophimus ill at Miletus.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="2Tim.4.21"><span class="verse-num">21&nbsp;</span>Do your utmost to come before winter. Eubulus, Pudens, Linus and Claudia send you their greetings, and so do all our Brothers.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="2Tim.4.22"><span class="verse-num">22&nbsp;</span>May the Lord be with your soul. God bless you all.</span>
