<span class="verse" data-osis="1John.2.1"><span class="verse-num verse-1">1&nbsp;</span>My children, I am writing to you to keep you from sinning; but if any one should sin, we have one who can plead for us with the Father &mdash; Jesus Christ, the Righteous &mdash;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="1John.2.2"><span class="verse-num">2&nbsp;</span>and he is the atoning sacrifice for our sins, and not for ours only, but for those of the whole world besides.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="1John.2.3"><span class="verse-num">3&nbsp;</span>And by this we know that we have learned to know him &mdash; by our laying his commands to heart.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="1John.2.4"><span class="verse-num">4&nbsp;</span>The man who says &lsquo;I know Jesus,&rsquo; but does not lay his commands to heart, is a liar, and the Truth has no place in him;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="1John.2.5"><span class="verse-num">5&nbsp;</span>but, whenever a man lays his Message to heart, in that man the love of God has indeed reached its perfection. By this we know that we are in union with God &mdash;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="1John.2.6"><span class="verse-num">6&nbsp;</span>He who professes to maintain union with God is himself bound to live as Christ lived.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="1John.2.7"><span class="verse-num">7&nbsp;</span>Dear friends, it is no new command that I am writing to you, but an old command, which you have had from the first. That old command is the Message to which you listened.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="1John.2.8"><span class="verse-num">8&nbsp;</span>Yet, again, it is a new Command that I am writing to you &mdash;  manifest in Christ&rsquo;s life and in your own &mdash; for the Darkness is passing away and the true Light is already shining.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="1John.2.9"><span class="verse-num">9&nbsp;</span>He who says that he is in the Light, and yet hates his Brother, is in the Darkness even now.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="1John.2.10"><span class="verse-num">10&nbsp;</span>He who loves his Brother is always in the Light, and there is nothing within him to cause him to stumble;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="1John.2.11"><span class="verse-num">11&nbsp;</span>while he who hates his Brother is in the Darkness, and is living in the Darkness, and does not know where he is going, because the Darkness prevents his seeing.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="1John.2.12"><span class="verse-num">12&nbsp;</span>I am writing, Children, to you, because your sins have been forgiven you for Christ&rsquo;s sake.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="1John.2.13"><span class="verse-num">13&nbsp;</span>I am writing, Fathers, to you, because you have learned to know him who has been from the Beginning. I am writing, Young Men, to you, because you have conquered the Evil One. I write, Children, to you, because you have learned to know the Father.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="1John.2.14"><span class="verse-num">14&nbsp;</span>I write, Fathers, to you, because you have learned to know him who has been from the Beginning. I write, Young Men, to you, because you are strong, and God&rsquo;s Message is always in your hearts, and you have conquered the Evil One.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="1John.2.15"><span class="verse-num">15&nbsp;</span>Do not love the world or what the world can offer. When any one loves the world, there is no love for the Father in him;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="1John.2.16"><span class="verse-num">16&nbsp;</span>for all that the world can offer &mdash; the gratification of the earthly nature, the gratification of the eye, the pretentious life &mdash; belongs, not to the Father, but to the world.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="1John.2.17"><span class="verse-num">17&nbsp;</span>And the world, and all that it gratifies, is passing away, but he who does God&rsquo;s will remains for ever.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="1John.2.18"><span class="verse-num">18&nbsp;</span>My Children, these are the last days. You were told that an Anti-Christ was coming; and many Anti-Christ&rsquo;s have already arisen. By that we know that these are the last days.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="1John.2.19"><span class="verse-num">19&nbsp;</span>From us, it is true, they went out, but they had never belonged to us; for, if they had belonged to us, they would have remained among us. They left us that it might be made clear that they do not, any of them, belong to us.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="1John.2.20"><span class="verse-num">20&nbsp;</span>You, however, have received consecration from the Holy One.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="1John.2.21"><span class="verse-num">21&nbsp;</span>You all know &mdash; But I am not writing to you because you do not know the Truth, but because you do know it, and because nothing false can come from the Truth.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="1John.2.22"><span class="verse-num">22&nbsp;</span>Who is a liar, if not the man who rejects the truth that Jesus is the Christ? He is the Anti-Christ &mdash; The man who rejects the Father and the Son.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="1John.2.23"><span class="verse-num">23&nbsp;</span>No one who rejects the Son has found the Father; he who acknowledges the Son has found the Father also.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="1John.2.24"><span class="verse-num">24&nbsp;</span>As for you, let what you were told at the first be always in your thoughts. If, then, what you were told at the first is always in your thoughts, you yourselves will maintain your union both with the Son and with the Father.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="1John.2.25"><span class="verse-num">25&nbsp;</span>And this is what he himself promised us &mdash; The Immortal Life!</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="1John.2.26"><span class="verse-num">26&nbsp;</span>In writing thus to you, I have in mind those who are trying to mislead you.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="1John.2.27"><span class="verse-num">27&nbsp;</span>But you &mdash; you still retain in your hears that consecration which you received from the Christ, and are not in need of any one to teach you; but, since his consecration of you teaches you about everything, and since it is a real consecration, and no lie, then, as it has taught you, maintain your union with him.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="1John.2.28"><span class="verse-num">28&nbsp;</span>Yes, my Children, maintain your union with Christ, so that, whenever he appears, our confidence may not fail us, and we may not be ashamed to meet him at his coming.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="1John.2.29"><span class="verse-num">29&nbsp;</span>Knowing him to be righteous, you realise that every one who lives righteously has received the new Life from him.</span>
