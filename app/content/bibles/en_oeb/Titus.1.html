<h3>Paul’s Letter to Titus</h3>
<h2 class="chapter-num">1</h2>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="Titus.1.1"><span class="verse-num verse-1">1&nbsp;</span>From Paul, a servant of God, and an Apostle of Jesus Christ, charged to strengthen the faith of God&rsquo;s Chosen People, and their knowledge of that Truth which makes for godliness, .</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Titus.1.2"><span class="verse-num">2&nbsp;</span>and is based on the hope of Immortal Life, which God, who never lies, promised before the ages began,</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Titus.1.3"><span class="verse-num">3&nbsp;</span>and has revealed at his own time in his Message, with the proclamation of which I was entrusted by the command of God our Saviour.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Titus.1.4"><span class="verse-num">4&nbsp;</span>To Titus, my true Child in our one Faith: May God, the Father, and Christ Jesus, our Saviour, bless you and give you peace.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Titus.1.5"><span class="verse-num">5&nbsp;</span>My reason for leaving you in Crete was that you might put in order what had been left unsettled, and appoint Officers of the Church in the various towns, as I myself directed you.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Titus.1.6"><span class="verse-num">6&nbsp;</span>They are to be men of irreproachable character, who are faithful husbands, whose children are Christians and have never been charged with dissolute conduct or have been unruly.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Titus.1.7"><span class="verse-num">7&nbsp;</span>For a Presiding-Officer, as God&rsquo;s steward, ought to be a man of irreproachable character; not self-willed or quick-tempered, nor addicted to drink or to brawling or to questionable money-making.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Titus.1.8"><span class="verse-num">8&nbsp;</span>On the contrary, he should be hospitable, eager for the right discreet, upright, a man of holy life and capable of self-restraint,</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Titus.1.9"><span class="verse-num">9&nbsp;</span>who holds doctrine that can be relied on as being in accordance with the accepted Teaching; so that he may be able to encourage others by sound teaching, as well as to refute our opponents.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Titus.1.10"><span class="verse-num">10&nbsp;</span>There are, indeed, many unruly persons &mdash; great talkers who deceive themselves, principally converts from Judaism,</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Titus.1.11"><span class="verse-num">11&nbsp;</span>whose mouths ought to be stopped; for they upset whole households by teaching what they ought not to teach, merely to make questionable gains.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Titus.1.12"><span class="verse-num">12&nbsp;</span>It was a Cretan &mdash; one of their own teachers &mdash; who said: &lsquo;Cretans are always liars, base brutes, and gluttonous idlers&rsquo;; and his statement is true.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Titus.1.13"><span class="verse-num">13&nbsp;</span>Therefore rebuke them sharply, so that they may be sound in the Faith,</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Titus.1.14"><span class="verse-num">14&nbsp;</span>and may pay no attention to Jewish legends, or to the directions of those who turn their backs upon the Truth.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Titus.1.15"><span class="verse-num">15&nbsp;</span>Everything is pure to the pure-minded, but to those whose minds are polluted and who are unbelievers nothing is pure. Their minds and consciences are alike polluted.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Titus.1.16"><span class="verse-num">16&nbsp;</span>They profess to know God, but by their actions they disown him. They are degraded and self-willed; and, as far as anything good is concerned, they are utterly worthless.</span>
