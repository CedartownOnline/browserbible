<span class="verse" data-osis="John.12.1"><span class="verse-num verse-1">1&nbsp;</span>Six days before the Passover Jesus came to Bethany, where Lazarus, whom he had raised from the dead, was living.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.12.2"><span class="verse-num">2&nbsp;</span>There a supper was given in honour at which Martha waited, while Lazarus was one of those present at the table.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.12.3"><span class="verse-num">3&nbsp;</span>So Mary took a pound of choice spikenard perfume of great value, and anointed the feet of Jesus with it, and then wiped them with her hair. The whole house was filled with the scent of the perfume.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.12.4"><span class="verse-num">4&nbsp;</span>One of the disciples, Judas Iscariot, who was about to betray Jesus, asked:</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.12.5"><span class="verse-num">5&nbsp;</span>&ldquo;Why was not this perfume sold for thirty pounds, and the money given to poor people?&rdquo;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.12.6"><span class="verse-num">6&nbsp;</span>He said this, not because he cared for the poor, but because he was a thief, and, being in charge of the purse, used to take what was put in it.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.12.7"><span class="verse-num">7&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> &ldquo;Let her alone,&rdquo;</span>  said Jesus, <span class="woc"> &ldquo;that she may keep it till the day when my body is being prepared for burial.</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.12.8"><span class="verse-num">8&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> The poor you always have with you, but you will not always have me.&rdquo;</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.12.9"><span class="verse-num">9&nbsp;</span>Now great numbers of the Jews found out that Jesus was at Bethany; and they came there, not solely on his account, but also to see Lazarus, whom he had raised from the dead.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.12.10"><span class="verse-num">10&nbsp;</span>The Chief Priests, however, plotted to put Lazarus, as well as Jesus, to death,</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.12.11"><span class="verse-num">11&nbsp;</span>because it was owing to him that many of the Jews had left them, and were becoming believers in Jesus.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.12.12"><span class="verse-num">12&nbsp;</span>On the following day great numbers of people who had come to the Festival, hearing that Jesus was on his way to Jerusalem, took palm-branches,</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.12.13"><span class="verse-num">13&nbsp;</span>and went out to meet him, shouting as they went: &ldquo;&lsquo;God save Him! Blessed is He who Comes in the name of the Lord&rsquo; &mdash; The King of Israel!&rdquo;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.12.14"><span class="verse-num">14&nbsp;</span>Having found a young ass, Jesus seated himself on it, in accordance with the passage of Scripture &mdash;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.12.15"><span class="verse-num">15&nbsp;</span>&lsquo;Fear not, Daughter of Zion; Behold, thy King is coming to thee, Sitting on the foal of an ass.&rsquo;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.12.16"><span class="verse-num">16&nbsp;</span>His disciples did not understand all this at first; but, when Jesus had been exalted, then they remembered that these things had been said of him in Scripture, and that they had done these things for him.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.12.17"><span class="verse-num">17&nbsp;</span>Meanwhile the people who were with him, when he called Lazarus out of the tomb and raised him from the dead, were telling what they had seen.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.12.18"><span class="verse-num">18&nbsp;</span>This, indeed, was why the crowd met him &mdash; because people had heard that he had given this sign of his mission.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.12.19"><span class="verse-num">19&nbsp;</span>So the Pharisees said to one another: &ldquo;You see that you are gaining nothing! Why, all the world has run after him!&rdquo;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.12.20"><span class="verse-num">20&nbsp;</span>Among those who were going up to worship at the Festival were some Greeks,</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.12.21"><span class="verse-num">21&nbsp;</span>who went to Philip of Bethsaida in Galilee, and said: &ldquo;Sir, we wish to see Jesus.&rdquo;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.12.22"><span class="verse-num">22&nbsp;</span>Philip went and told Andrew, and then together they went and told Jesus.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.12.23"><span class="verse-num">23&nbsp;</span>This was his reply &mdash; <span class="woc"> &ldquo;The time has come for the Son of Man to be exalted.</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.12.24"><span class="verse-num">24&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> In truth I tell you, unless a grain of wheat falls into the ground and dies, it remains solitary; but, if it dies, it becomes fruitful.</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.12.25"><span class="verse-num">25&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> He who loves his life loses it; while he who hates his life in the present world shall preserve it for Immortal Life.</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.12.26"><span class="verse-num">26&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> If a man is ready to serve me, let him follow me; and where I am, there my servant shall be also. If a man is ready to serve me, my Father will honour him.</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.12.27"><span class="verse-num">27&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> Now I am distressed at heart and what can I say? Father, bring me safe through this hour &mdash; yet it was for this very reason that I came to this hour &mdash; </span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.12.28"><span class="verse-num">28&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> Father, honour thine own name.&rdquo;</span>  At this there came a voice from Heaven, which said: &ldquo;I have already honoured it, and I will honour it again.&rdquo;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.12.29"><span class="verse-num">29&nbsp;</span>The crowd of bystanders, who heard the sound, said that it was thundering. Others said: &ldquo;An angel has been speaking to him.&rdquo;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.12.30"><span class="verse-num">30&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> &ldquo;It was not for my sake that the voice came,&rdquo;</span>  said Jesus, <span class="woc"> &ldquo;but for yours.</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.12.31"><span class="verse-num">31&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> Now this world is on its trial. Now the Spirit that is ruling this world shall be driven out;</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.12.32"><span class="verse-num">32&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> and I, when I am lifted up from the earth, shall draw all men to myself.&rdquo;</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.12.33"><span class="verse-num">33&nbsp;</span>By these words he indicated what death he was destined to die.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.12.34"><span class="verse-num">34&nbsp;</span>&ldquo;We,&rdquo; replied the people, &ldquo;have learned from the Law that the &lsquo;Christ is to remain for ever&rsquo;; how is it, then, that you say that the Son of Man must be <span class="woc"> &lsquo;lifted up&rsquo;</span>  Who is this &lsquo;Son of Man&rsquo;?&rdquo;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.12.35"><span class="verse-num">35&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> &ldquo;Only a little while longer,&rdquo;</span>  answered Jesus, <span class="woc"> &ldquo;will you have the Light among you. Travel on while you have the Light, so that darkness may not overtake you; he who travels in the darkness does not know where he is going.</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.12.36"><span class="verse-num">36&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> While you still have the Light, believe in the Light, that you may be &lsquo;Sons of Light.&rsquo;&rdquo;</span>  After he had said this, Jesus went away, and hid himself from them.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.12.37"><span class="verse-num">37&nbsp;</span>But, though Jesus had given so many signs of his mission before their eyes, they still did not believe in him,</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.12.38"><span class="verse-num">38&nbsp;</span>in fulfilment of the words of the Prophet Isaiah, where he says &mdash; &lsquo;Lord, who has believed our teaching? And to whom has the might of the Lord been revealed?&rsquo;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.12.39"><span class="verse-num">39&nbsp;</span>The reason why they were unable to believe is given by Isaiah elsewhere, in these words &mdash;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.12.40"><span class="verse-num">40&nbsp;</span>&lsquo;He has blinded their eyes, and blunted their mind, so that they should not see with their eyes, and perceive with their mind, and turn &mdash; And I should heal them.&rsquo;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.12.41"><span class="verse-num">41&nbsp;</span>Isaiah said this, because he saw Christ&rsquo;s glory; and it was of him that he spoke.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.12.42"><span class="verse-num">42&nbsp;</span>Yet for all this, even among the leading men there were many who came to believe in Jesus; but, on account of the Pharisees, they did not acknowledge it, for fear that they should be expelled from their Synagogues;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.12.43"><span class="verse-num">43&nbsp;</span>for they valued honour from men more than honour from God.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.12.44"><span class="verse-num">44&nbsp;</span>But Jesus had proclaimed: <span class="woc"> &ldquo;He who believes in me believes, not in me, but in him who sent me;</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.12.45"><span class="verse-num">45&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> and he who sees me sees him who sent me.</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.12.46"><span class="verse-num">46&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> I have come as a Light into the world, that no one who believes in me should remain in the darkness.</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.12.47"><span class="verse-num">47&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> When any one hears my teaching and pays no heed to it, I am not his judge; for I came not to judge the world, but to save the world.</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.12.48"><span class="verse-num">48&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> He who rejects me, and disregards my teaching, has a judge already &mdash; the very Message which I have delivered will itself be his judge at the Last Day.</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.12.49"><span class="verse-num">49&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> For I have not delivered it on my own authority; but the Father, who sent me, has himself given me his command as to what I should say, and what message I should deliver.</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.12.50"><span class="verse-num">50&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> And I know that Immortal Life lies in keeping his command. Therefore, whatever I say, I say only what the Father has taught me.&rdquo;</span></span>
