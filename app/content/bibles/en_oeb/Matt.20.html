<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.20.1"><span class="verse-num verse-1">1&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> For the Kingdom of Heaven is like an employer who went out in the early morning to hire labourers for his vineyards.</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.20.2"><span class="verse-num">2&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> He agreed with the labourers to pay them two shillings a day, and sent them into his vineyard.</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.20.3"><span class="verse-num">3&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> On going out again, about nine o&rsquo;clock, he saw some others standing in the market-place, doing nothing.</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.20.4"><span class="verse-num">4&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> &lsquo;You also may go into my vineyard,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;and I will pay you what is fair.&rsquo;</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.20.5"><span class="verse-num">5&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> So the men went. Going out again about mid-day and about three o&rsquo;clock, he did as before.</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.20.6"><span class="verse-num">6&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> When he went out about five, he found some other men standing there, and said to them &lsquo;Why have you been standing here all day long, doing nothing?&rsquo;</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.20.7"><span class="verse-num">7&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> &lsquo;Because no one has hired us,&rsquo; they answered. &lsquo;You also may go into my vineyard,&rsquo; he said.</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.20.8"><span class="verse-num">8&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> In the evening the owner of the vineyard said to his steward &lsquo;Call the labourers, and pay them their wages, beginning with the last, and ending with the first.</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.20.9"><span class="verse-num">9&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> Now when those who had been hired about five o&rsquo;clock went up, they received two shillings each.</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.20.10"><span class="verse-num">10&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> So, when the first went up, they thought that they would receive more, but they also received two shillings each;</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.20.11"><span class="verse-num">11&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> on which they began to grumble at their employer.</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.20.12"><span class="verse-num">12&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> &lsquo;These last,&rsquo; they said, &lsquo;have done only one hour&rsquo;s work, and yet you have put them on the same footing with us, who have borne the brunt of the day&rsquo;s work, and the heat.&rsquo;</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.20.13"><span class="verse-num">13&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> &lsquo;My friend,&rsquo; was his reply to one of them, &lsquo;I am not treating you unfairly. Did not you agree with me for two shillings?</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.20.14"><span class="verse-num">14&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> Take what belongs to you, and go. I choose to give to this last man the same as to you.</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.20.15"><span class="verse-num">15&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> Have not I the right to do as I choose with what is mine? Are you envious because I am liberal?&rsquo;</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.20.16"><span class="verse-num">16&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> So those who are last will be first, and the first last.&rdquo; </span></span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.20.17"><span class="verse-num">17&nbsp;</span>When Jesus was on the point of going up to Jerusalem, he gathered the twelve disciples round him by themselves, and said to them as they were on their way:</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.20.18"><span class="verse-num">18&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> &ldquo;Listen! We are going up to Jerusalem; and there the Son of Man will be betrayed to the Chief Priests and Teachers of the Law, and they will condemn him to death,</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.20.19"><span class="verse-num">19&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> and give him up to the Gentiles for them to mock, and to scourge, and to crucify; and on the third day he will rise.&rdquo; </span></span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.20.20"><span class="verse-num">20&nbsp;</span>Then the mother of Zebediah&rsquo;s sons came to him with her sons, bowing to the ground, and begging a favour.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.20.21"><span class="verse-num">21&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> &ldquo;What is it that you want?&rdquo; </span>  he asked. &ldquo;I want you to say,&rdquo; she replied, &ldquo;that in your Kingdom these two sons of mine may sit, one on your right, and the other on your left.&rdquo;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.20.22"><span class="verse-num">22&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> &ldquo;You do not know what you are asking,&rdquo; </span>  was Jesus&rsquo; answer. <span class="woc"> &ldquo;Can you drink the cup that I am to drink?&rdquo; </span>  &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; they exclaimed, &ldquo;we can.&rdquo;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.20.23"><span class="verse-num">23&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> &ldquo;You shall indeed drink my cup,&rdquo; </span>  he said, <span class="woc"> &ldquo;but as to a seat at my right and at my left &mdash; that is not mine to give, but it is for those for whom it has been prepared by my Father.&rdquo; </span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.20.24"><span class="verse-num">24&nbsp;</span>On hearing of this, the ten others were very indignant about the two brothers.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.20.25"><span class="verse-num">25&nbsp;</span>Jesus, however, called the ten to him, and said: <span class="woc"> &ldquo;The rulers of the Gentiles lord it over them as you know, and their great men oppress them.</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.20.26"><span class="verse-num">26&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> Among you it is not so.</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.20.27"><span class="verse-num">27&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> No, whoever wants to become great among you must be your servant, and whoever wants to take the first place among you, must be your slave;</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.20.28"><span class="verse-num">28&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> just as the Son of Man came, not to be served, but to serve, and to give his life as a ransom for many.&rdquo; </span></span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.20.29"><span class="verse-num">29&nbsp;</span>As they were going out of Jericho, a great crowd followed him.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.20.30"><span class="verse-num">30&nbsp;</span>Two blind men who were sitting by the road-side, hearing that Jesus was passing, called out: &ldquo;Take pity on us, Master, Son of David!&rdquo;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.20.31"><span class="verse-num">31&nbsp;</span>The crowd told them to be quiet; but the men only called out the louder: &ldquo;Take pity on us, Master, Son of David!&rdquo;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.20.32"><span class="verse-num">32&nbsp;</span>Then Jesus stopped and called them. <span class="woc"> &ldquo;What do you want me to do for you?&rdquo; </span>  he said.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.20.33"><span class="verse-num">33&nbsp;</span>&ldquo;Master,&rdquo; they replied, &ldquo;we want our eyes to be opened.&rdquo;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.20.34"><span class="verse-num">34&nbsp;</span>So Jesus, moved with compassion, touched their eyes, and immediately they recovered their sight, and followed him.</span>
