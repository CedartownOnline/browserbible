<span class="verse" data-osis="John.16.1"><span class="verse-num verse-1">1&nbsp;</span>I have spoken to you in this way so that you may not falter.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.16.2"><span class="verse-num">2&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> They will expel you from their Synagogues; indeed the time is coming when any one who kills you will think that he is making an offering to God.</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.16.3"><span class="verse-num">3&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> They will do this, because they have not learned to know the Father, or even me.</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.16.4"><span class="verse-num">4&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> But I have spoken to you of these things that, when the time for them comes, you may remember that I told you about them myself.</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.16.5"><span class="verse-num">5&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> I did not tell you all this at first, because I was with you. But now I am to return to him who sent me; and yet not one of you asks me &mdash; &lsquo;Where are you going?&rsquo;</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.16.6"><span class="verse-num">6&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> Although your hearts are full of sorrow at all that I have been saying to you.</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.16.7"><span class="verse-num">7&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> Yet I am only telling you the truth; it is for your good that I should go away. For otherwise the Helper will never come to you, but, if I leave you, I will send him to you.</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.16.8"><span class="verse-num">8&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> And he, when he comes, will bring conviction to the world as to Sin, and as to Righteousness, and as to Judgment;</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.16.9"><span class="verse-num">9&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> as to Sin, for men do not believe in me;</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.16.10"><span class="verse-num">10&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> as to Righteousness, for I am going to the Father, and you will see me no longer;</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.16.11"><span class="verse-num">11&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> as to Judgment, for the Spirit that is ruling this world has been condemned.</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.16.12"><span class="verse-num">12&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> I have still much to say to you, but you cannot bear it now.</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.16.13"><span class="verse-num">13&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> Yet when he &mdash; The Spirit of Truth &mdash; comes, he will guide you into all Truth; for he will not speak on his own authority, but he will speak of all that he hears; and he will tell you of the things that are to come.</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.16.14"><span class="verse-num">14&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> He will honour me; because he will take of what is mine, and will tell it to you.</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.16.15"><span class="verse-num">15&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> Everything that the Father has is mine; that is why I said that he takes of what is mine, and will tell it to you.</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.16.16"><span class="verse-num">16&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> In a little while you will no longer see me; and then in a little while you will see me indeed.&rdquo;</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.16.17"><span class="verse-num">17&nbsp;</span>At this some of his disciples said to one another: &ldquo;What does he mean by saying to us <span class="woc"> &lsquo;In a little while you will not see me, and then in a little while you will see me indeed&rsquo;;</span>  and by saying <span class="woc"> &lsquo;Because I am going to the Father&rsquo;?</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.16.18"><span class="verse-num">18&nbsp;</span>What does he mean by <span class="woc"> &lsquo;In a little while&rsquo;?&rdquo;</span>  they said; &ldquo;we do not know what he is speaking about.&rdquo;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.16.19"><span class="verse-num">19&nbsp;</span>Jesus saw that they were wanting to ask him a question, and said: <span class="woc"> &ldquo;Are you trying to find out from one another what I meant by saying &lsquo;In a little while you will not see me; and then in a little while you will see me indeed&rsquo;?</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.16.20"><span class="verse-num">20&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> In truth I tell you that you will weep and mourn, but the world will rejoice; you will suffer pain, but your pain shall turn to joy.</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.16.21"><span class="verse-num">21&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> A woman in labor is in pain because her time has come; but no sooner is the child born, than she forgets her trouble in her joy that a man has been born into the world.</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.16.22"><span class="verse-num">22&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> You, in the same way, are sorry now; but I shall see you again, and your hearts will rejoice, and no one will rob you of your joy.</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.16.23"><span class="verse-num">23&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> And at that time you will not ask me anything; in truth I tell you, if you ask the Father for anything, he will grant it to you in my Name.</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.16.24"><span class="verse-num">24&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> So far you have not asked for anything, in my Name; ask, and you will receive, so that your joy may be complete.</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.16.25"><span class="verse-num">25&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> I have spoken to you of all this in figures; a time is coming, however, when I shall not speak any longer to you in figures, but shall tell you about the Father plainly.</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.16.26"><span class="verse-num">26&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> You will ask, at that time, in my Name; and I do not say that I will intercede with the Father for you;</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.16.27"><span class="verse-num">27&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> for the Father himself loves you, because you have loved me, and have believed that I came from the Father.</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.16.28"><span class="verse-num">28&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> I came out from the Father, and have come into the world; and now I am to leave the world, and go to the Father.&rdquo;</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.16.29"><span class="verse-num">29&nbsp;</span>&ldquo;At last,&rdquo; exclaimed the disciples, &ldquo;you are using plain words and not speaking in figures at all.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.16.30"><span class="verse-num">30&nbsp;</span>Now we are sure that you know everything, and need not wait for any one to question you. This makes us believe that you did come from God.&rdquo;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.16.31"><span class="verse-num">31&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> &ldquo;Do you believe that already?&rdquo;</span>  Jesus answered.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.16.32"><span class="verse-num">32&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> &ldquo;Listen! a time is coming &mdash; indeed it has already come &mdash; when you are to be scattered, each going his own way, and to leave me alone; and yet I am not alone, because the Father is with me.</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.16.33"><span class="verse-num">33&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> I have spoken to you in this way, so that in me you may find peace. In the world you will find trouble; yet, take courage! I have conquered the world.&rdquo;</span></span>
