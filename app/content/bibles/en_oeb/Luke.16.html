<span class="verse Luke_16_1" data-osis="Luke.16.1"><span class="verse-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span>Jesus said to his disciples: <span class="woc"> &ldquo;There was a rich man who had a steward; and this steward was maliciously accused to him of wasting his estate.</span></span>
<span class="verse Luke_16_2" data-osis="Luke.16.2"><span class="verse-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> So the master called him and said &lsquo;What is this that I hear about you? Give in your accounts, for you cannot act as steward any longer.&rsquo;</span></span>
<span class="verse Luke_16_3" data-osis="Luke.16.3"><span class="verse-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> &lsquo;What am I to do,&rsquo; the steward asked himself, &lsquo;now that my master is taking the steward&rsquo;s place away from me? I have not strength to dig, and I am ashamed to beg.</span></span>
<span class="verse Luke_16_4" data-osis="Luke.16.4"><span class="verse-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> I know what I will do, so that, as soon as I am turned out of my stewardship, people may welcome me into their homes.&rsquo;</span></span>
<span class="verse Luke_16_5" data-osis="Luke.16.5"><span class="verse-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> One by one he called up his master&rsquo;s debtors. &lsquo;How much do you owe my master?&rsquo; he asked of the first.</span></span>
<span class="verse Luke_16_6" data-osis="Luke.16.6"><span class="verse-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> &lsquo;Four hundred and forty gallons of oil,&rsquo; answered the man. &lsquo;Here is your agreement,&rsquo; he said; &lsquo;sit down at once and make it two hundred and twenty.&rsquo;</span></span>
<span class="verse Luke_16_7" data-osis="Luke.16.7"><span class="verse-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> And you, the steward said to the next, &lsquo;how much do you owe?&rsquo; &lsquo;Seventy quarters of wheat,&rsquo; he replied. &lsquo;Here is your agreement,&rsquo; the steward said; &lsquo;make it fifty-six.&rsquo;</span></span>
<span class="verse Luke_16_8" data-osis="Luke.16.8"><span class="verse-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> His master complimented this dishonest steward on the shrewdness of his action. And indeed men of the world are shrewder in dealing with their fellow-men than those who have the Light.</span></span>
<span class="verse Luke_16_9" data-osis="Luke.16.9"><span class="verse-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> And I say to you &lsquo;Win friends for yourselves with your dishonest money,&rsquo; so that, when it comes to an end, there may be a welcome for you into the Eternal Home.</span></span>
<span class="verse Luke_16_10" data-osis="Luke.16.10"><span class="verse-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> He who is trustworthy in the smallest matter is trustworthy in a great one also; and he who is dishonest in the smallest matter is dishonest in a great one also.</span></span>
<span class="verse Luke_16_11" data-osis="Luke.16.11"><span class="verse-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> So, if you have proved untrustworthy with the &lsquo;dishonest money,&rsquo; who will trust you with the true?</span></span>
<span class="verse Luke_16_12" data-osis="Luke.16.12"><span class="verse-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> And, if you have proved untrustworthy with what does not belong to us, who will give you what is really our own?</span></span>
<span class="verse Luke_16_13" data-osis="Luke.16.13"><span class="verse-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> No servant can serve two masters, for, either he will hate one and love the other, or else he will attach himself to one and despise the other. You cannot serve both God and Money.&rdquo;</span></span>
<span class="verse Luke_16_14" data-osis="Luke.16.14"><span class="verse-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span>All this was said within hearing of the Pharisees, who were lovers of money, and they began to sneer at Jesus.</span>
<span class="verse Luke_16_15" data-osis="Luke.16.15"><span class="verse-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> &ldquo;You,&rdquo;</span>  said Jesus, <span class="woc"> &ldquo;are the men who justify themselves before the world, but God can read your hearts; and what is highly esteemed among men may be an abomination in the sight of God.</span></span>
<span class="verse Luke_16_16" data-osis="Luke.16.16"><span class="verse-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> The Law and the Prophets sufficed until the time of John. Since then the Good News of the Kingdom of God has been told, and everybody has been forcing his way into it.</span></span>
<span class="verse Luke_16_17" data-osis="Luke.16.17"><span class="verse-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> It would be easier for the heavens and the earth to disappear than for one stroke of a letter in the Law to be lost.</span></span>
<span class="verse Luke_16_18" data-osis="Luke.16.18"><span class="verse-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> Every one who divorces his wife and marries another woman is an adulterer, and the man who marries a divorced woman is an adulterer.</span></span>
<span class="verse Luke_16_19" data-osis="Luke.16.19"><span class="verse-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> There was once a rich man, who dressed in purple robes and fine linen, and feasted every day in great splendour.</span></span>
<span class="verse Luke_16_20" data-osis="Luke.16.20"><span class="verse-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> Near his gateway there had been laid a beggar named Lazarus, who was covered with sores,</span></span>
<span class="verse Luke_16_21" data-osis="Luke.16.21"><span class="verse-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> and who longed to satisfy his hunger with what fell from the rich man&rsquo;s table. Even the very dogs came and licked his sores.</span></span>
<span class="verse Luke_16_22" data-osis="Luke.16.22"><span class="verse-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> After a time the beggar died, and was taken by the angels to be with Abraham. The rich man also died and was buried.</span></span>
<span class="verse Luke_16_23" data-osis="Luke.16.23"><span class="verse-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> In the Place of Death he looked up in his torment, and saw Abraham at a distance and Lazarus at his side.</span></span>
<span class="verse Luke_16_24" data-osis="Luke.16.24"><span class="verse-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> So he called out &lsquo;Pity me, Father Abraham, and send Lazarus to dip the tip of his finger in water and cool my tongue, for I am suffering agony in this flame.&rsquo;</span></span>
<span class="verse Luke_16_25" data-osis="Luke.16.25"><span class="verse-num v-25">25&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> &lsquo;Child,&rsquo; answered Abraham, &lsquo;remember that you in your lifetime received what you thought desirable, just as Lazarus received what was not desirable; but now he has his consolation here, while you are suffering agony.</span></span>
<span class="verse Luke_16_26" data-osis="Luke.16.26"><span class="verse-num v-26">26&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> And not only that, but between you and us there lies a great chasm, so that those who wish to pass from here to you cannot, nor can they cross from there to us.&rsquo;</span></span>
<span class="verse Luke_16_27" data-osis="Luke.16.27"><span class="verse-num v-27">27&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> &lsquo;Then, Father,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;I beg you to send Lazarus to my father&rsquo;s house &mdash; </span></span>
<span class="verse Luke_16_28" data-osis="Luke.16.28"><span class="verse-num v-28">28&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> For I have five brothers to warn them, so that they may not come to this place of torture also.&rsquo;</span></span>
<span class="verse Luke_16_29" data-osis="Luke.16.29"><span class="verse-num v-29">29&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> &lsquo;They have the writings of Moses and the Prophets,&rsquo; replied Abraham; &lsquo;let them listen to them.&rsquo;</span></span>
<span class="verse Luke_16_30" data-osis="Luke.16.30"><span class="verse-num v-30">30&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> &lsquo;But, Father Abraham,&rsquo; he urged, &lsquo;if some one from the dead were to go to them, they would repent.&rsquo;</span></span>
<span class="verse Luke_16_31" data-osis="Luke.16.31"><span class="verse-num v-31">31&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> &lsquo;If they do not listen to Moses and the Prophets,&rsquo; answered Abraham, &lsquo;they will not be persuaded, even if some one were to rise from the dead.&rsquo;&rdquo;</span></span>
