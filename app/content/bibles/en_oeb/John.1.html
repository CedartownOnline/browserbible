<h3>The Good News According to John</h3>
<h2 class="chapter-num">1</h2>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="John.1.1"><span class="verse-num verse-1">1&nbsp;</span>In the Beginning the Word was; and the Word was with God; and the Word was God.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.1.2"><span class="verse-num">2&nbsp;</span>He was in the Beginning with God;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.1.3"><span class="verse-num">3&nbsp;</span>through him all things came into being, and nothing came into being apart from him.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.1.4"><span class="verse-num">4&nbsp;</span>That which came into being in him was Life; and the Life was the Light of Man;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.1.5"><span class="verse-num">5&nbsp;</span>and the Light shines in the darkness, and the darkness never overpowered it.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.1.6"><span class="verse-num">6&nbsp;</span>There appeared a man sent from God, whose name was John;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.1.7"><span class="verse-num">7&nbsp;</span>he came as a witness &mdash; to bear witness to the Light that through him all men might believe.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.1.8"><span class="verse-num">8&nbsp;</span>He was not the Light, but he came to bear witness to the Light.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.1.9"><span class="verse-num">9&nbsp;</span>That was the True Light which enlightens every man coming into the world.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.1.10"><span class="verse-num">10&nbsp;</span>He was in the world; and through him the world came into being &mdash; yet the world did not know him.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.1.11"><span class="verse-num">11&nbsp;</span>He came to his own &mdash; yet his own did not receive him.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.1.12"><span class="verse-num">12&nbsp;</span>But to all who did receive him he gave power to become Children of God &mdash; to those who believe in his Name.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.1.13"><span class="verse-num">13&nbsp;</span>For not to natural conception, nor to human instincts, nor to will of man did they owe the new Life, but to God.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.1.14"><span class="verse-num">14&nbsp;</span>And the Word became Man, and dwelt among us, (We saw his glory &mdash; the glory of the Only Son sent from the Father), full of love and truth.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.1.15"><span class="verse-num">15&nbsp;</span>(John bears witness to him; he cried aloud &mdash; for it was he who spoke &mdash; &ldquo;&lsquo;He who is Coming&rsquo; after me is now before me, for he was ever first&rdquo;);</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.1.16"><span class="verse-num">16&nbsp;</span>out of his fullness we have all received some gift, gift after gift of love;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.1.17"><span class="verse-num">17&nbsp;</span>for the Law was given through Moses, love and truth came through Jesus Christ.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.1.18"><span class="verse-num">18&nbsp;</span>No man has ever yet seen God; God the Only Son, who is ever with the Father &mdash; He has revealed him.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.1.19"><span class="verse-num">19&nbsp;</span>When the Jews sent some Priests and Levites to John from Jerusalem, to ask &mdash; &ldquo;Who are you?&rdquo;, his statement was this:</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.1.20"><span class="verse-num">20&nbsp;</span>He confessed and did not deny it, he confessed &mdash; &ldquo;I am not the Christ.&rdquo;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.1.21"><span class="verse-num">21&nbsp;</span>&ldquo;What then?&rdquo; they asked. &ldquo;Are you Elijah?&rdquo; &ldquo;No,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I am not.&rdquo; &ldquo;Are you &lsquo;the Prophet&rsquo;?&rdquo; He answered, &ldquo;No.&rdquo;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.1.22"><span class="verse-num">22&nbsp;</span>&ldquo;Who then are you?&rdquo; they continued; &ldquo;tell us, that we may have some answer to give to those who have sent us. What do you say about yourself?&rdquo;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.1.23"><span class="verse-num">23&nbsp;</span>&ldquo;I,&rdquo; he answered, &ldquo;am &mdash; &lsquo;The voice of one crying aloud in the Wilderness &mdash; &ldquo;straighten the way of the Lord&rdquo;&rsquo;, as the Prophet Isaiah said.&rdquo;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.1.24"><span class="verse-num">24&nbsp;</span>These men had been sent from the Pharisees;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.1.25"><span class="verse-num">25&nbsp;</span>and their next question was: &ldquo;Why then do you baptize, if you are not the Christ, nor Elijah, nor yet &lsquo;the Prophet&rsquo;?&rdquo;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.1.26"><span class="verse-num">26&nbsp;</span>John&rsquo;s answer was &mdash; &ldquo;I baptize with water, but among you stands one whom you do not know;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.1.27"><span class="verse-num">27&nbsp;</span>he is coming after me, yet I am not worthy even to unfasten his sandal.&rdquo;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.1.28"><span class="verse-num">28&nbsp;</span>All this took place at Bethany, across the Jordan, where John was then baptizing.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.1.29"><span class="verse-num">29&nbsp;</span>The next day John saw Jesus coming towards him, and exclaimed: &ldquo;Here is the Lamb of God, who is to take away the sin of the world!</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.1.30"><span class="verse-num">30&nbsp;</span>It was of him that I spoke when I said &lsquo;After me there is coming a man who is now before me, for he was ever First.&rsquo;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.1.31"><span class="verse-num">31&nbsp;</span>I myself did not know him, but, that he may be made known to Israel, I have come, baptizing with water.&rdquo;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.1.32"><span class="verse-num">32&nbsp;</span>John also made this statement &mdash; &ldquo;I have seen the Spirit descending as a dove out of the heavens, and it remained upon him.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.1.33"><span class="verse-num">33&nbsp;</span>I myself did not know him, but he who sent me to baptize with water, he said to me &lsquo;He upon whom you see the Spirit descending, and remaining upon him &mdash; he it is who baptizes with the Holy Spirit.&rsquo;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.1.34"><span class="verse-num">34&nbsp;</span>This I have seen myself, and I have declared my belief that he is the Son of God.&rdquo;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.1.35"><span class="verse-num">35&nbsp;</span>The next day, when John was standing with two of his disciples,</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.1.36"><span class="verse-num">36&nbsp;</span>he looked at Jesus as he passed and exclaimed: &ldquo;There is the Lamb of God!&rdquo;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.1.37"><span class="verse-num">37&nbsp;</span>The two disciples heard him say this, and followed Jesus.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.1.38"><span class="verse-num">38&nbsp;</span>But Jesus turned round, and saw them following. <span class="woc"> &ldquo;What are you looking for?&rdquo;</span>  he asked. &ldquo;Rabbi,&rdquo; they answered (or, as we should say, &ldquo;Teacher&rdquo;), &ldquo;where are you staying?&rdquo;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.1.39"><span class="verse-num">39&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> &ldquo;Come, and you shall see,&rdquo;</span>  he replied. So they went, and saw where he was staying, and spent that day with him. It was then about four in the afternoon.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.1.40"><span class="verse-num">40&nbsp;</span>One of the two, who heard what John said and followed Jesus, was Andrew, Simon Peter&rsquo;s brother.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.1.41"><span class="verse-num">41&nbsp;</span>He first found his own brother Simon, and said to him: &ldquo;We have found the Messiah!&rdquo; (a word which means &lsquo;Christ,&rsquo; or &lsquo;Consecrated&rsquo;.)</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.1.42"><span class="verse-num">42&nbsp;</span>Then he brought him to Jesus. Fixing his eyes on him, Jesus said: <span class="woc"> &ldquo;You are Simon, the son of John; you shall be called Kephas&rdquo;</span>  (which means &lsquo;Peter,&rsquo; or &lsquo;Rock&rsquo;).</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.1.43"><span class="verse-num">43&nbsp;</span>The following day Jesus decided to leave for Galilee. He found Philip, and said to him: <span class="woc"> &ldquo;Follow me.&rdquo;</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.1.44"><span class="verse-num">44&nbsp;</span>Philip was from Bethsaida, and a fellow-townsman of Andrew and Peter.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.1.45"><span class="verse-num">45&nbsp;</span>He found Nathanael and said to him: &ldquo;We have found him of whom Moses wrote in the Law, and of whom the Prophets also wrote &mdash; Jesus of Nazareth, Joseph&rsquo;s son!&rdquo;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.1.46"><span class="verse-num">46&nbsp;</span>&ldquo;Can anything good come out of Nazareth?&rdquo; asked Nathanael. &ldquo;Come and see,&rdquo; replied Philip.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.1.47"><span class="verse-num">47&nbsp;</span>When Jesus saw Nathanael coming towards him, he said: <span class="woc"> &ldquo;Here is a true Israelite, in whom there is no deceit!&rdquo;</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.1.48"><span class="verse-num">48&nbsp;</span>&ldquo;How do you know me?&rdquo; asked Nathanael. <span class="woc"> &ldquo;Even before Philip called you,&rdquo;</span>  replied Jesus, <span class="woc"> &ldquo;when you were under the fig tree, I saw you.&rdquo;</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.1.49"><span class="verse-num">49&nbsp;</span>&ldquo;Rabbi,&rdquo; Nathanael exclaimed, &ldquo;you are the Son of God, you are King of Israel!&rdquo;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.1.50"><span class="verse-num">50&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> &ldquo;Do you believe in me,&rdquo;</span>  asked Jesus, <span class="woc"> &ldquo;because I told you that I saw you under the fig tree? You shall see greater things than those!</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.1.51"><span class="verse-num">51&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> In truth I tell you,&rdquo;</span>  he added, <span class="woc"> &ldquo;you shall all see Heaven open, and &lsquo;the angels of God ascending and descending&rsquo; upon the Son of Man.&rdquo;</span></span>
