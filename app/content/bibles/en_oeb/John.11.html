<span class="verse John_11_1" data-osis="John.11.1"><span class="verse-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span>Now a man named Lazarus, of Bethany, was lying ill; he belonged to the same village as Mary and her sister Martha.</span>
<span class="verse John_11_2" data-osis="John.11.2"><span class="verse-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span>This Mary, whose brother Lazarus was ill, was the Mary who anointed the Master with perfume, and wiped his feet with her hair.</span>
<span class="verse John_11_3" data-osis="John.11.3"><span class="verse-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span>The sisters, therefore, sent this message to Jesus &mdash; &lsquo;Master, your friend is ill&rsquo;;</span>
<span class="verse John_11_4" data-osis="John.11.4"><span class="verse-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span>and, when Jesus heard it, he said: <span class="woc"> &ldquo;This illness is not to end in death, but is to redound to the honor of God, in order that the Son of God may be honoured through it.&rdquo;</span></span>
<span class="verse John_11_5" data-osis="John.11.5"><span class="verse-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span>Jesus loved Martha and her sister, and Lazarus.</span>
<span class="verse John_11_6" data-osis="John.11.6"><span class="verse-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span>Yet, when he heard of the illness of Lazarus, he still stayed two days in the place where he was.</span>
<span class="verse John_11_7" data-osis="John.11.7"><span class="verse-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span>Then, after that, he said to his disciples: <span class="woc"> &ldquo;Let us go to Judea again.&rdquo;</span></span>
<span class="verse John_11_8" data-osis="John.11.8"><span class="verse-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span>&ldquo;Rabbi,&rdquo; they replied, &ldquo;the Jews were but just now seeking to stone you; and are you going there again?&rdquo;</span>
<span class="verse John_11_9" data-osis="John.11.9"><span class="verse-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> &ldquo;Are not there twelve hours in the day?&rdquo;</span>  answered Jesus. <span class="woc"> &ldquo;If a man walks about in the day-time, he does not stumble, because he can see the light of the sun;</span></span>
<span class="verse John_11_10" data-osis="John.11.10"><span class="verse-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> but, if he walks about at night, he stumbles, because he has not the light.&rdquo;</span></span>
<span class="verse John_11_11" data-osis="John.11.11"><span class="verse-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span>And, when he had said this, he added: <span class="woc"> &ldquo;Our friend Lazarus has fallen asleep; but I am going that I may wake him.&rdquo;</span></span>
<span class="verse John_11_12" data-osis="John.11.12"><span class="verse-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span>&ldquo;If he has fallen asleep, Master, he will get well,&rdquo; said the disciples.</span>
<span class="verse John_11_13" data-osis="John.11.13"><span class="verse-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span>But Jesus meant that he was dead; they, however, supposed that he was speaking of natural sleep.</span>
<span class="verse John_11_14" data-osis="John.11.14"><span class="verse-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span>Then he said to them plainly: <span class="woc"> &ldquo;Lazarus is dead;</span></span>
<span class="verse John_11_15" data-osis="John.11.15"><span class="verse-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> and I am glad for your sakes that I was not there, so that you may learn to believe in me. But let us go to him.&rdquo;</span></span>
<span class="verse John_11_16" data-osis="John.11.16"><span class="verse-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span>At this, Thomas, who was called &lsquo;The Twin,&rsquo; said to his fellow-disciples: &ldquo;Let us go too, so that we may die with him.&rdquo;</span>
<span class="verse John_11_17" data-osis="John.11.17"><span class="verse-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span>When Jesus reached the place, he found that Lazarus had been four days in the tomb already.</span>
<span class="verse John_11_18" data-osis="John.11.18"><span class="verse-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span>Bethany being only about two miles from Jerusalem,</span>
<span class="verse John_11_19" data-osis="John.11.19"><span class="verse-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span>a number of the Jews had come there to condole with Martha and Mary on their brother&rsquo;s death.</span>
<span class="verse John_11_20" data-osis="John.11.20"><span class="verse-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span>When Martha heard that Jesus was coming, she went to meet him; but Mary sat quietly at home.</span>
<span class="verse John_11_21" data-osis="John.11.21"><span class="verse-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span>&ldquo;Master,&rdquo; Martha said to Jesus, &ldquo;if you had been here, my brother would not have died.</span>
<span class="verse John_11_22" data-osis="John.11.22"><span class="verse-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span>Even now, I know that God will grant you whatever you ask him.&rdquo;</span>
<span class="verse John_11_23" data-osis="John.11.23"><span class="verse-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> &ldquo;Your brother shall rise to life,&rdquo;</span>  said Jesus.</span>
<span class="verse John_11_24" data-osis="John.11.24"><span class="verse-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span>&ldquo;I know that he will,&rdquo; replied Martha, &ldquo;in the resurrection at the Last Day.&rdquo;</span>
<span class="verse John_11_25" data-osis="John.11.25"><span class="verse-num v-25">25&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> &ldquo;I am the Resurrection and the Life,&rdquo;</span>  said Jesus. <span class="woc"> &ldquo;He that believes in me shall live, though he die;</span></span>
<span class="verse John_11_26" data-osis="John.11.26"><span class="verse-num v-26">26&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> and he who lives and believes in me shall never die. Do you believe this?&rdquo;</span></span>
<span class="verse John_11_27" data-osis="John.11.27"><span class="verse-num v-27">27&nbsp;</span>&ldquo;Yes Master,&rdquo; she answered; &ldquo;I have learned to believe that you are the Christ, the Son of God, &lsquo;who was to come&rsquo; into the world.&rdquo;</span>
<span class="verse John_11_28" data-osis="John.11.28"><span class="verse-num v-28">28&nbsp;</span>After saying this, Martha went and called her sister Mary, and whispered: &ldquo;The Teacher is here, and is asking for you.&rdquo;</span>
<span class="verse John_11_29" data-osis="John.11.29"><span class="verse-num v-29">29&nbsp;</span>As soon as Mary heard that, she got up quickly, and went to meet him.</span>
<span class="verse John_11_30" data-osis="John.11.30"><span class="verse-num v-30">30&nbsp;</span>Jesus had not then come into the village, but was still at the place where Martha had met him.</span>
<span class="verse John_11_31" data-osis="John.11.31"><span class="verse-num v-31">31&nbsp;</span>So the Jews, who were in the house with Mary, condoling with her, when they saw her get up quickly and go out, followed her, thinking that she was going to the tomb to weep there.</span>
<span class="verse John_11_32" data-osis="John.11.32"><span class="verse-num v-32">32&nbsp;</span>When Mary came where Jesus was and saw him, she threw herself at his feet. &ldquo;Master,&rdquo; she exclaimed, &ldquo;if you had been here, my brother would not have died!&rdquo;</span>
<span class="verse John_11_33" data-osis="John.11.33"><span class="verse-num v-33">33&nbsp;</span>When Jesus saw her weeping, and the Jews who had come with her weeping also, he groaned deeply, and was greatly distressed.</span>
<span class="verse John_11_34" data-osis="John.11.34"><span class="verse-num v-34">34&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> &ldquo;Where have you buried him?&rdquo;</span>  he asked. &ldquo;Come and see, Master,&rdquo; they answered.</span>
<span class="verse John_11_35" data-osis="John.11.35"><span class="verse-num v-35">35&nbsp;</span>Jesus burst into tears.</span>
<span class="verse John_11_36" data-osis="John.11.36"><span class="verse-num v-36">36&nbsp;</span>&ldquo;How he must have loved him!&rdquo; the Jews exclaimed;</span>
<span class="verse John_11_37" data-osis="John.11.37"><span class="verse-num v-37">37&nbsp;</span>but some of them said: &ldquo;Could not this man, who gave sight to the blind man, have also prevented Lazarus from dying?&rdquo;</span>
<span class="verse John_11_38" data-osis="John.11.38"><span class="verse-num v-38">38&nbsp;</span>Again groaning inwardly, Jesus came to the tomb. It was a cave, and a stone lay against the mouth of it.</span>
<span class="verse John_11_39" data-osis="John.11.39"><span class="verse-num v-39">39&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> &ldquo;Move the stone away,&rdquo;</span>  said Jesus. &ldquo;Master,&rdquo; said Martha, the sister of the dead man, &ldquo;by this time the smell must be offensive, for this is the fourth day since his death.&rdquo;</span>
<span class="verse John_11_40" data-osis="John.11.40"><span class="verse-num v-40">40&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> &ldquo;Did not I tell you,&rdquo;</span>  replied Jesus, <span class="woc"> &ldquo;that, if you would believe in me, you should see the glory of God?&rdquo;</span></span>
<span class="verse John_11_41" data-osis="John.11.41"><span class="verse-num v-41">41&nbsp;</span>So they moved the stone away; and Jesus, with uplifted eyes, said: <span class="woc"> &ldquo;Father, I thank thee that thou hast heard my prayer;</span></span>
<span class="verse John_11_42" data-osis="John.11.42"><span class="verse-num v-42">42&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> I know that thou always headrest me; but I say this for the sake of the people standing near, so that they may believe that thou has sent me as thy Messenger.&rdquo;</span></span>
<span class="verse John_11_43" data-osis="John.11.43"><span class="verse-num v-43">43&nbsp;</span>Then, after saying this, Jesus called in a loud voice: <span class="woc"> &ldquo;Lazarus! come out!&rdquo;</span></span>
<span class="verse John_11_44" data-osis="John.11.44"><span class="verse-num v-44">44&nbsp;</span>The dead man came out, wrapped hand and foot in a winding- sheet; his face, too, had been wrapped in a cloth. <span class="woc"> &ldquo;Set him free,&rdquo;</span>  said Jesus, <span class="woc"> &ldquo;and let him go.&rdquo;</span></span>
<span class="verse John_11_45" data-osis="John.11.45"><span class="verse-num v-45">45&nbsp;</span>In consequence of this, many of the Jews, who had come to visit Mary and had seen what Jesus did, learned to believe in him.</span>
<span class="verse John_11_46" data-osis="John.11.46"><span class="verse-num v-46">46&nbsp;</span>Some of them, however, went to the Pharisees, and told them what he had done.</span>
<span class="verse John_11_47" data-osis="John.11.47"><span class="verse-num v-47">47&nbsp;</span>Upon this the Chief Priests and the Pharisees called a meeting of the High Council, and said: &ldquo;What are we to do, now that this man is giving so many signs?</span>
<span class="verse John_11_48" data-osis="John.11.48"><span class="verse-num v-48">48&nbsp;</span>If we let him alone as we are doing, every one will believe in him; and the Romans will come and will take from us both our City and our Nationality.&rdquo;</span>
<span class="verse John_11_49" data-osis="John.11.49"><span class="verse-num v-49">49&nbsp;</span>One of them, however, Caiaphas, who was High Priest that year, said to them:</span>
<span class="verse John_11_50" data-osis="John.11.50"><span class="verse-num v-50">50&nbsp;</span>&ldquo;You are utterly mistaken. You do not consider that it is better for you that one man should die for the people, rather than the whole nation should be destroyed.&rdquo;</span>
<span class="verse John_11_51" data-osis="John.11.51"><span class="verse-num v-51">51&nbsp;</span>Now he did not say this of his own accord; but, as High Priest that year, he prophesied that Jesus was to die for the nation &mdash;</span>
<span class="verse John_11_52" data-osis="John.11.52"><span class="verse-num v-52">52&nbsp;</span>And not for the nation only, but also that he might unite in one body the Children of God now scattered far and wide.</span>
<span class="verse John_11_53" data-osis="John.11.53"><span class="verse-num v-53">53&nbsp;</span>So from that day they plotted to put Jesus to death.</span>
<span class="verse John_11_54" data-osis="John.11.54"><span class="verse-num v-54">54&nbsp;</span>In consequence of this, Jesus did not go about publicly among the Jews any more, but left that neighbourhood, and went into the country bordering on the Wilderness, to a town called Ephraim, where he stayed with his disciples.</span>
<span class="verse John_11_55" data-osis="John.11.55"><span class="verse-num v-55">55&nbsp;</span>But the Jewish Festival of the Passover was near; and many people had gone up from the country to Jerusalem, for their &lsquo;purification,&rsquo; before the Festival began.</span>
<span class="verse John_11_56" data-osis="John.11.56"><span class="verse-num v-56">56&nbsp;</span>So they looked for Jesus there, and said to one another, as they stood in the Temple Courts: &ldquo;What do you think? Do you think he will come to the Festival?&rdquo;</span>
<span class="verse John_11_57" data-osis="John.11.57"><span class="verse-num v-57">57&nbsp;</span>The Chief Priests and the Pharisees had already issued orders that, if any one learned where Jesus was, he should give information, so that they might arrest him.</span>
