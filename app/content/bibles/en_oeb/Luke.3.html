<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.3.1"><span class="verse-num verse-1">1&nbsp;</span>In the fifteenth year of the reign of the Emperor Tiberius, when Pontius Pilate was Governor of Judea, Herod Ruler of Galilee, his brother Philip Ruler of the territory comprising Ituraea and Trachonitis, and Lysanias Ruler of Abilene,</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.3.2"><span class="verse-num">2&nbsp;</span>and when Annas and Caiaphas were High Priests, a Command from God came to John, the son of Zechariah, while he was in the wilderness.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.3.3"><span class="verse-num">3&nbsp;</span>And John went through the whole district of the Jordan, proclaiming baptism upon repentance, for the forgiveness of sins.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.3.4"><span class="verse-num">4&nbsp;</span>This was in fulfilment of what is said in the writings of the Prophet Isaiah &mdash; &lsquo;The voice of one crying aloud in the wilderness: &ldquo;Make ready the way of the Lord, Make his paths straight.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.3.5"><span class="verse-num">5&nbsp;</span>Every chasm shall be filled, Every mountain and hill shall be levelled, The winding ways shall be straightened, The rough roads made smooth,</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.3.6"><span class="verse-num">6&nbsp;</span>and all mankind shall see the Salvation of God.&rdquo;&rsquo;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.3.7"><span class="verse-num">7&nbsp;</span>And John said to the crowds that went to be baptized by him: &ldquo;You brood of vipers! who has prompted you to seek refuge from the coming judgment?</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.3.8"><span class="verse-num">8&nbsp;</span>Let your lives, then, prove your repentance; and do not begin to say among yourselves &lsquo;Abraham is our ancestor,&rsquo; for I tell you that out of these very stones God is able to raise descendants for Abraham!</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.3.9"><span class="verse-num">9&nbsp;</span>Already, indeed, the axe is lying at the root of the trees. Therefore every tree that fails to bear good fruit will be cut down and thrown into the fire.&rdquo;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.3.10"><span class="verse-num">10&nbsp;</span>&ldquo;What are we to do then?&rdquo; the people asked.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.3.11"><span class="verse-num">11&nbsp;</span>&ldquo;Let the man who has two coats,&rdquo; answered John, &ldquo;share with him who has none; and the man who has food do the same.&rdquo;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.3.12"><span class="verse-num">12&nbsp;</span>Even tax-gatherers came to be baptized, and said to John: &ldquo;Teacher, what are we to do?&rdquo;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.3.13"><span class="verse-num">13&nbsp;</span>&ldquo;Do not collect more than you have authority to demand,&rdquo; John answered.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.3.14"><span class="verse-num">14&nbsp;</span>And when some soldiers on active service asked &ldquo;And we &mdash; what are we to do?&rdquo; he said: &ldquo;Never use violence, or exact anything by false accusation; and be content with your pay.&rdquo;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.3.15"><span class="verse-num">15&nbsp;</span>Then, while the people were in suspense, and were all debating with themselves whether John could be the Christ,</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.3.16"><span class="verse-num">16&nbsp;</span>John, addressing them all, said: &ldquo;I, indeed, baptize you with water; but there is coming one more powerful than I, and I am not fit even to unfasten his sandals. He will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and with fire.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.3.17"><span class="verse-num">17&nbsp;</span>His winnowing-fan is in his hand, that he may clear his threshing-floor, and store the grain in his barn, but the chaff he will burn with inextinguishable fire.&rdquo;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.3.18"><span class="verse-num">18&nbsp;</span>And so with many different exhortations John told his Good News to the people.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.3.19"><span class="verse-num">19&nbsp;</span>But Prince Herod, being rebuked by John respecting Herodias, the wife of Herod&rsquo;s brother, and for all the evil things that he had done,</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.3.20"><span class="verse-num">20&nbsp;</span>crowned them all by shutting John up in prison.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.3.21"><span class="verse-num">21&nbsp;</span>Now after the baptism of all the people, and when Jesus had been baptized and was still praying, the heavens opened,</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.3.22"><span class="verse-num">22&nbsp;</span>and the Holy Spirit descended, in a visible form, like a dove, upon him, and from the heavens came a voice &mdash; &ldquo;Thou art my Son, the Beloved; in thee I delight.&rdquo;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.3.23"><span class="verse-num">23&nbsp;</span>When beginning his work, Jesus was about thirty years old. He was regarded as the son of Joseph, whose ancestors were &mdash; Eli,</span>
