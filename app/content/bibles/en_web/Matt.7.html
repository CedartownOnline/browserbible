<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.7.2"><span class="verse-num">2&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> For with whatever judgment you judge, you will be judged; and with whatever measure you measure, it will be measured to you. </span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.7.3"><span class="verse-num">3&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> Why do you see the speck that is in your brother&rsquo;s eye, but don&rsquo;t consider the beam that is in your own eye? </span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.7.4"><span class="verse-num">4&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> Or how will you tell your brother, &lsquo;Let me remove the speck from your eye;&rsquo; and behold, the beam is in your own eye? </span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.7.5"><span class="verse-num">5&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> You hypocrite! First remove the beam out of your own eye, and then you can see clearly to remove the speck out of your brother&rsquo;s eye.</span></span>

<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.7.7"><span class="verse-num">7&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> &ldquo;Ask, and it will be given you. Seek, and you will find. Knock, and it will be opened for you. </span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.7.8"><span class="verse-num">8&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> For everyone who asks receives. He who seeks finds. To him who knocks it will be opened. </span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.7.9"><span class="verse-num">9&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> Or who is there among you, who, if his son asks him for bread, will give him a stone? </span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.7.10"><span class="verse-num">10&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> Or if he asks for a fish, who will give him a serpent? </span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.7.11"><span class="verse-num">11&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> If you then, being evil, know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more will your Father who is in heaven give good things to those who ask him! </span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.7.17"><span class="verse-num">17&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> Even so, every good tree produces good fruit; but the corrupt tree produces evil fruit. </span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.7.21"><span class="verse-num">21&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> Not everyone who says to me, &lsquo;Lord, Lord,&rsquo; will enter into the Kingdom of Heaven; but he who does the will of my Father who is in heaven. </span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.7.22"><span class="verse-num">22&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> Many will tell me in that day, &lsquo;Lord, Lord, didn&rsquo;t we prophesy in your name, in your name cast out demons, and in your name do many mighty works?&rsquo; </span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.7.23"><span class="verse-num">23&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> Then I will tell them, &lsquo;I never knew you. Depart from me, you who work iniquity.&rsquo;</span></span>
