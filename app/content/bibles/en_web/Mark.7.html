<span class="verse" data-osis="Mark.7.2"><span class="verse-num">2&nbsp;</span>Now when they saw some of his disciples eating bread with defiled, that is, unwashed, hands, they found fault.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Mark.7.3"><span class="verse-num">3&nbsp;</span>(For the Pharisees, and all the Jews, don&rsquo;t eat unless they wash their hands and forearms, holding to the tradition of the elders.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Mark.7.4"><span class="verse-num">4&nbsp;</span>They don&rsquo;t eat when they come from the marketplace, unless they bathe themselves, and there are many other things, which they have received to hold to: washings of cups, pitchers, bronze vessels, and couches.)</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Mark.7.5"><span class="verse-num">5&nbsp;</span>The Pharisees and the scribes asked him, &ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t your disciples walk according to the tradition of the elders, but eat their bread with unwashed hands?&rdquo;</span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="Mark.7.6"><span class="verse-num">6&nbsp;</span>He answered them, <span class="woc"> &ldquo;Well did Isaiah prophesy of you hypocrites, as it is written,</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Mark.7.7"><span class="verse-num">7&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> But in vain do they worship me,</span></span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="Mark.7.8"><span class="verse-num">8&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> &ldquo;For you set aside the commandment of God, and hold tightly to the tradition of men&mdash;the washing of pitchers and cups, and you do many other such things.&rdquo;</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Mark.7.9"><span class="verse-num">9&nbsp;</span>He said to them, <span class="woc"> &ldquo;Full well do you reject the commandment of God, that you may keep your tradition. </span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Mark.7.10"><span class="verse-num">10&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> For Moses said, &lsquo;Honor your father and your mother;&rsquo;</span><span class="cf">+<dfn>Exodus 20:12; Deuteronomy 5:16</dfn></span><span class="woc"> and, &lsquo;He who speaks evil of father or mother, let him be put to death.&rsquo;</span><span class="cf">+<dfn>Exodus 21:17; Leviticus 20:9</dfn></span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Mark.7.11"><span class="verse-num">11&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> But you say, &lsquo;If a man tells his father or his mother, &ldquo;Whatever profit you might have received from me is Corban</span><span class="note">+<dfn>Corban is a Hebrew word for an offering devoted to God.</dfn></span><span class="woc"> , that is to say, given to God&rdquo;;&rsquo; </span></span>

<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="Mark.7.14"><span class="verse-num">14&nbsp;</span>He called all the multitude to himself, and said to them, <span class="woc"> &ldquo;Hear me, all of you, and understand. </span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Mark.7.15"><span class="verse-num">15&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> There is nothing from outside of the man, that going into him can defile him; but the things which proceed out of the man are those that defile the man. </span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Mark.7.16"><span class="verse-num">16&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> If anyone has ears to hear, let him hear!&rdquo;</span></span>

<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="Mark.7.17"><span class="verse-num">17&nbsp;</span>When he had entered into a house away from the multitude, his disciples asked him about the parable.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Mark.7.18"><span class="verse-num">18&nbsp;</span>He said to them, <span class="woc"> &ldquo;Are you thus without understanding also? Don&rsquo;t you perceive that whatever goes into the man from outside can&rsquo;t defile him, </span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Mark.7.19"><span class="verse-num">19&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> because it doesn&rsquo;t go into his heart, but into his stomach, then into the latrine, thus purifying all foods</span><span class="note">+<dfn>or, making all foods clean</dfn></span><span class="woc"> ?&rdquo;</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Mark.7.20"><span class="verse-num">20&nbsp;</span>He said, <span class="woc"> &ldquo;That which proceeds out of the man, that defiles the man. </span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Mark.7.21"><span class="verse-num">21&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> For from within, out of the hearts of men, proceed evil thoughts, adulteries, sexual sins, murders, thefts, </span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Mark.7.22"><span class="verse-num">22&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> covetings, wickedness, deceit, lustful desires, an evil eye, blasphemy, pride, and foolishness. </span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Mark.7.23"><span class="verse-num">23&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> All these evil things come from within, and defile the man.&rdquo; </span></span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="Mark.7.24"><span class="verse-num">24&nbsp;</span>From there he arose, and went away into the borders of Tyre and Sidon. He entered into a house, and didn&rsquo;t want anyone to know it, but he couldn&rsquo;t escape notice.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Mark.7.25"><span class="verse-num">25&nbsp;</span>For a woman, whose little daughter had an unclean spirit, having heard of him, came and fell down at his feet.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Mark.7.26"><span class="verse-num">26&nbsp;</span>Now the woman was a Greek, a Syrophoenician by race. She begged him that he would cast the demon out of her daughter.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Mark.7.27"><span class="verse-num">27&nbsp;</span>But Jesus said to her, <span class="woc"> &ldquo;Let the children be filled first, for it is not appropriate to take the children&rsquo;s bread and throw it to the dogs.&rdquo; </span></span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="Mark.7.28"><span class="verse-num">28&nbsp;</span>But she answered him, &ldquo;Yes, Lord. Yet even the dogs under the table eat the children&rsquo;s crumbs.&rdquo;</span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="Mark.7.29"><span class="verse-num">29&nbsp;</span>He said to her, <span class="woc"> &ldquo;For this saying, go your way. The demon has gone out of your daughter.&rdquo;</span></span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="Mark.7.30"><span class="verse-num">30&nbsp;</span>She went away to her house, and found the child having been laid on the bed, with the demon gone out.</span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="Mark.7.31"><span class="verse-num">31&nbsp;</span>Again he departed from the borders of Tyre and Sidon, and came to the sea of Galilee, through the midst of the region of Decapolis.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Mark.7.32"><span class="verse-num">32&nbsp;</span>They brought to him one who was deaf and had an impediment in his speech. They begged him to lay his hand on him.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Mark.7.33"><span class="verse-num">33&nbsp;</span>He took him aside from the multitude, privately, and put his fingers into his ears, and he spat, and touched his tongue.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Mark.7.34"><span class="verse-num">34&nbsp;</span>Looking up to heaven, he sighed, and said to him, <span class="woc"> &ldquo;Ephphatha!&rdquo; </span> that is, <span class="woc"> &ldquo;Be opened!&rdquo;</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Mark.7.35"><span class="verse-num">35&nbsp;</span>Immediately his ears were opened, and the impediment of his tongue was released, and he spoke clearly.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Mark.7.36"><span class="verse-num">36&nbsp;</span>He commanded them that they should tell no one, but the more he commanded them, so much the more widely they proclaimed it.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Mark.7.37"><span class="verse-num">37&nbsp;</span>They were astonished beyond measure, saying, &ldquo;He has done all things well. He makes even the deaf hear, and the mute speak!&rdquo;</span>
