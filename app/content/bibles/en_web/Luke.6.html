<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.6.1"><span class="verse-num verse-1">1&nbsp;</span>Now it happened on the second Sabbath after the first, that he was going through the grain fields. His disciples plucked the heads of grain, and ate, rubbing them in their hands.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.6.2"><span class="verse-num">2&nbsp;</span>But some of the Pharisees said to them, &ldquo;Why do you do that which is not lawful to do on the Sabbath day?&rdquo;</span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.6.3"><span class="verse-num">3&nbsp;</span>Jesus, answering them, said, <span class="woc"> &ldquo;Haven&rsquo;t you read what David did when he was hungry, he, and those who were with him; </span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.6.4"><span class="verse-num">4&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> how he entered into God&rsquo;s house, and took and ate the show bread, and gave also to those who were with him, which is not lawful to eat except for the priests alone?&rdquo;</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.6.5"><span class="verse-num">5&nbsp;</span>He said to them, <span class="woc"> &ldquo;The Son of Man is lord of the Sabbath.&rdquo;</span></span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.6.6"><span class="verse-num">6&nbsp;</span>It also happened on another Sabbath that he entered into the synagogue and taught. There was a man there, and his right hand was withered.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.6.7"><span class="verse-num">7&nbsp;</span>The scribes and the Pharisees watched him, to see whether he would heal on the Sabbath, that they might find an accusation against him.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.6.8"><span class="verse-num">8&nbsp;</span>But he knew their thoughts; and he said to the man who had the withered hand, <span class="woc"> &ldquo;Rise up, and stand in the middle.&rdquo;</span> He arose and stood.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.6.9"><span class="verse-num">9&nbsp;</span>Then Jesus said to them, <span class="woc"> &ldquo;I will ask you something: Is it lawful on the Sabbath to do good, or to do harm? To save a life, or to kill?&rdquo;</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.6.10"><span class="verse-num">10&nbsp;</span>He looked around at them all, and said to the man, <span class="woc"> &ldquo;Stretch out your hand.&rdquo;</span> He did, and his hand was restored as sound as the other.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.6.11"><span class="verse-num">11&nbsp;</span>But they were filled with rage, and talked with one another about what they might do to Jesus.</span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.6.12"><span class="verse-num">12&nbsp;</span>It happened in these days, that he went out to the mountain to pray, and he continued all night in prayer to God.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.6.13"><span class="verse-num">13&nbsp;</span>When it was day, he called his disciples, and from them he chose twelve, whom he also named apostles:</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.6.17"><span class="verse-num">17&nbsp;</span>He came down with them, and stood on a level place, with a crowd of his disciples, and a great number of the people from all Judea and Jerusalem, and the sea coast of Tyre and Sidon, who came to hear him and to be healed of their diseases;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.6.18"><span class="verse-num">18&nbsp;</span>as well as those who were troubled by unclean spirits, and they were being healed.</span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.6.20"><span class="verse-num">20&nbsp;</span>He lifted up his eyes to his disciples, and said,</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.6.22"><span class="verse-num">22&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> Blessed are you when men shall hate you, and when they shall exclude and mock you, and throw out your name as evil, for the Son of Man&rsquo;s sake. </span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.6.23"><span class="verse-num">23&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> Rejoice in that day, and leap for joy, for behold, your reward is great in heaven, for their fathers did the same thing to the prophets.</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.6.24"><span class="verse-num">24&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> &ldquo;But woe to you who are rich!</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.6.30"><span class="verse-num">30&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> Give to everyone who asks you, and don&rsquo;t ask him who takes away your goods to give them back again.</span></span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.6.31"><span class="verse-num">31&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> &ldquo;As you would like people to do to you, do exactly so to them. </span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.6.32"><span class="verse-num">32&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> If you love those who love you, what credit is that to you? For even sinners love those who love them. </span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.6.33"><span class="verse-num">33&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> If you do good to those who do good to you, what credit is that to you? For even sinners do the same. </span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.6.34"><span class="verse-num">34&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> If you lend to those from whom you hope to receive, what credit is that to you? Even sinners lend to sinners, to receive back as much. </span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.6.35"><span class="verse-num">35&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> But love your enemies, and do good, and lend, expecting nothing back; and your reward will be great, and you will be children of the Most High; for he is kind toward the unthankful and evil.</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.6.36"><span class="verse-num">36&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> &ldquo;Therefore be merciful,</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.6.41"><span class="verse-num">41&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> Why do you see the speck of chaff that is in your brother&rsquo;s eye, but don&rsquo;t consider the beam that is in your own eye? </span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.6.42"><span class="verse-num">42&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> Or how can you tell your brother, &lsquo;Brother, let me remove the speck of chaff that is in your eye,&rsquo; when you yourself don&rsquo;t see the beam that is in your own eye? You hypocrite! First remove the beam from your own eye, and then you can see clearly to remove the speck of chaff that is in your brother&rsquo;s eye. </span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.6.44"><span class="verse-num">44&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> For each tree is known by its own fruit. For people don&rsquo;t gather figs from thorns, nor do they gather grapes from a bramble bush. </span></span>
