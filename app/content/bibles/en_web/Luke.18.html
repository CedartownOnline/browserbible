<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.18.1"><span class="verse-num verse-1">1&nbsp;</span>He also spoke a parable to them that they must always pray, and not give up,</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.18.2"><span class="verse-num">2&nbsp;</span>saying, <span class="woc"> &ldquo;There was a judge in a certain city who didn&rsquo;t fear God, and didn&rsquo;t respect man. </span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.18.3"><span class="verse-num">3&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> A widow was in that city, and she often came to him, saying, &lsquo;Defend me from my adversary!&rsquo; </span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.18.4"><span class="verse-num">4&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> He wouldn&rsquo;t for a while, but afterward he said to himself, &lsquo;Though I neither fear God, nor respect man, </span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.18.5"><span class="verse-num">5&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> yet because this widow bothers me, I will defend her, or else she will wear me out by her continual coming.&rsquo;&rdquo;</span></span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.18.6"><span class="verse-num">6&nbsp;</span>The Lord said, <span class="woc"> &ldquo;Listen to what the unrighteous judge says. </span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.18.7"><span class="verse-num">7&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> Won&rsquo;t God avenge his chosen ones, who are crying out to him day and night, and yet he exercises patience with them? </span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.18.8"><span class="verse-num">8&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> I tell you that he will avenge them quickly. Nevertheless, when the Son of Man comes, will he find faith on the earth?&rdquo;</span></span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.18.9"><span class="verse-num">9&nbsp;</span>He spoke also this parable to certain people who were convinced of their own righteousness, and who despised all others.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.18.10"><span class="verse-num">10&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> &ldquo;Two men went up into the temple to pray; one was a Pharisee, and the other was a tax collector. </span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.18.11"><span class="verse-num">11&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> The Pharisee stood and prayed to himself like this: &lsquo;God, I thank you, that I am not like the rest of men, extortionists, unrighteous, adulterers, or even like this tax collector. </span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.18.12"><span class="verse-num">12&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> I fast twice a week. I give tithes of all that I get.&rsquo; </span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.18.13"><span class="verse-num">13&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> But the tax collector, standing far away, wouldn&rsquo;t even lift up his eyes to heaven, but beat his breast, saying, &lsquo;God, be merciful to me, a sinner!&rsquo; </span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.18.14"><span class="verse-num">14&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> I tell you, this man went down to his house justified rather than the other; for everyone who exalts himself will be humbled, but he who humbles himself will be exalted.&rdquo;</span></span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.18.15"><span class="verse-num">15&nbsp;</span>They were also bringing their babies to him, that he might touch them. But when the disciples saw it, they rebuked them.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.18.16"><span class="verse-num">16&nbsp;</span>Jesus summoned them, saying, <span class="woc"> &ldquo;Allow the little children to come to me, and don&rsquo;t hinder them, for the Kingdom of God belongs to such as these. </span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.18.17"><span class="verse-num">17&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> Most certainly, I tell you, whoever doesn&rsquo;t receive the Kingdom of God like a little child, he will in no way enter into it.&rdquo;</span></span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.18.18"><span class="verse-num">18&nbsp;</span>A certain ruler asked him, saying, &ldquo;Good Teacher, what shall I do to inherit eternal life?&rdquo;</span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.18.19"><span class="verse-num">19&nbsp;</span>Jesus asked him, <span class="woc"> &ldquo;Why do you call me good? No one is good, except one&mdash;God. </span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.18.20"><span class="verse-num">20&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> You know the commandments: &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t commit adultery,&rsquo; &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t murder,&rsquo; &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t steal,&rsquo; &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t give false testimony,&rsquo; &lsquo;Honor your father and your mother.&rsquo;&rdquo;</span><span class="cf">+<dfn>Exodus 20:12-16; Deuteronomy 5:16-20</dfn></span></span>

<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.18.22"><span class="verse-num">22&nbsp;</span>When Jesus heard these things, he said to him, <span class="woc"> &ldquo;You still lack one thing. Sell all that you have, and distribute it to the poor. You will have treasure in heaven. Come, follow me.&rdquo;</span></span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.18.23"><span class="verse-num">23&nbsp;</span>But when he heard these things, he became very sad, for he was very rich.</span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.18.24"><span class="verse-num">24&nbsp;</span>Jesus, seeing that he became very sad, said, <span class="woc"> &ldquo;How hard it is for those who have riches to enter into the Kingdom of God! </span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.18.25"><span class="verse-num">25&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> For it is easier for a camel to enter in through a needle&rsquo;s eye, than for a rich man to enter into the Kingdom of God.&rdquo;</span></span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.18.26"><span class="verse-num">26&nbsp;</span>Those who heard it said, &ldquo;Then who can be saved?&rdquo;</span>

<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.18.28"><span class="verse-num">28&nbsp;</span>Peter said, &ldquo;Look, we have left everything, and followed you.&rdquo;</span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.18.29"><span class="verse-num">29&nbsp;</span>He said to them, <span class="woc"> &ldquo;Most certainly I tell you, there is no one who has left house, or wife, or brothers, or parents, or children, for the Kingdom of God&rsquo;s sake, </span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.18.30"><span class="verse-num">30&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> who will not receive many times more in this time, and in the world to come, eternal life.&rdquo;</span></span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.18.31"><span class="verse-num">31&nbsp;</span>He took the twelve aside, and said to them, <span class="woc"> &ldquo;Behold, we are going up to Jerusalem, and all the things that are written through the prophets concerning the Son of Man will be completed. </span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.18.32"><span class="verse-num">32&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> For he will be delivered up to the Gentiles, will be mocked, treated shamefully, and spit on. </span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.18.33"><span class="verse-num">33&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> They will scourge and kill him. On the third day, he will rise again.&rdquo;</span></span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.18.34"><span class="verse-num">34&nbsp;</span>They understood none of these things. This saying was hidden from them, and they didn&rsquo;t understand the things that were said.</span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.18.40"><span class="verse-num">40&nbsp;</span>Standing still, Jesus commanded him to be brought to him. When he had come near, he asked him,</span>
