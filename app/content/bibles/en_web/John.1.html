<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="John.1.1"><span class="verse-num verse-1">1&nbsp;</span>In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.1.2"><span class="verse-num">2&nbsp;</span>The same was in the beginning with God.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.1.3"><span class="verse-num">3&nbsp;</span>All things were made through him. Without him was not anything made that has been made.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.1.4"><span class="verse-num">4&nbsp;</span>In him was life, and the life was the light of men.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.1.5"><span class="verse-num">5&nbsp;</span>The light shines in the darkness, and the darkness hasn&rsquo;t overcome</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.1.6"><span class="verse-num">6&nbsp;</span>There came a man, sent from God, whose name was John.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.1.7"><span class="verse-num">7&nbsp;</span>The same came as a witness, that he might testify about the light, that all might believe through him.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.1.8"><span class="verse-num">8&nbsp;</span>He was not the light, but was sent that he might testify about the light.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.1.9"><span class="verse-num">9&nbsp;</span>The true light that enlightens everyone was coming into the world.</span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="John.1.10"><span class="verse-num">10&nbsp;</span>He was in the world, and the world was made through him, and the world didn&rsquo;t recognize him.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.1.11"><span class="verse-num">11&nbsp;</span>He came to his own, and those who were his own didn&rsquo;t receive him.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.1.12"><span class="verse-num">12&nbsp;</span>But as many as received him, to them he gave the right to become God&rsquo;s children, to those who believe in his name:</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.1.13"><span class="verse-num">13&nbsp;</span>who were born not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of God.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.1.14"><span class="verse-num">14&nbsp;</span>The Word became flesh, and lived among us. We saw his glory, such glory as of the one and only Son of the Father, full of grace and truth.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.1.15"><span class="verse-num">15&nbsp;</span>John testified about him. He cried out, saying, &ldquo;This was he of whom I said, &lsquo;He who comes after me has surpassed me, for he was before me.&rsquo;&rdquo;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.1.16"><span class="verse-num">16&nbsp;</span>From his fullness we all received grace upon grace.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.1.17"><span class="verse-num">17&nbsp;</span>For the law was given through Moses. Grace and truth were realized through Jesus Christ.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.1.18"><span class="verse-num">18&nbsp;</span>No one has seen God at any time. The one and only Son,<span class="note">+<dfn>NU reads &ldquo;God&rdquo;</dfn></span> who is in the bosom of the Father, he has declared him.</span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="John.1.19"><span class="verse-num">19&nbsp;</span>This is John&rsquo;s testimony, when the Jews sent priests and Levites from Jerusalem to ask him, &ldquo;Who are you?&rdquo;</span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="John.1.20"><span class="verse-num">20&nbsp;</span>He declared, and didn&rsquo;t deny, but he declared, &ldquo;I am not the Christ.&rdquo;</span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="John.1.21"><span class="verse-num">21&nbsp;</span>They asked him, &ldquo;What then? Are you Elijah?&rdquo;</span>

</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="John.1.22"><span class="verse-num">22&nbsp;</span>They said therefore to him, &ldquo;Who are you? Give us an answer to take back to those who sent us. What do you say about yourself?&rdquo;</span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="John.1.23"><span class="verse-num">23&nbsp;</span>He said, &ldquo;I am the voice of one crying in the wilderness, &lsquo;Make straight the way of the Lord,&rsquo;<span class="cf">+<dfn>Isaiah 40:3</dfn></span> as Isaiah the prophet said.&rdquo;</span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="John.1.24"><span class="verse-num">24&nbsp;</span>The ones who had been sent were from the Pharisees.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.1.25"><span class="verse-num">25&nbsp;</span>They asked him, &ldquo;Why then do you baptize, if you are not the Christ, nor Elijah, nor the prophet?&rdquo;</span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="John.1.26"><span class="verse-num">26&nbsp;</span>John answered them, &ldquo;I baptize in water, but among you stands one whom you don&rsquo;t know.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.1.27"><span class="verse-num">27&nbsp;</span>He is the one who comes after me, who is preferred before me, whose sandal strap I&rsquo;m not worthy to loosen.&rdquo;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.1.28"><span class="verse-num">28&nbsp;</span>These things were done in Bethany beyond the Jordan, where John was baptizing.</span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="John.1.29"><span class="verse-num">29&nbsp;</span>The next day, he saw Jesus coming to him, and said, &ldquo;Behold,<span class="note">+<dfn>&ldquo;Behold,&rdquo; from &ldquo;ἰδοὺ,&rdquo; means look at, take notice, observe, see, or gaze at. It is often used as an interjection.</dfn></span> the Lamb of God, who takes away the sin of the world!</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.1.30"><span class="verse-num">30&nbsp;</span>This is he of whom I said, &lsquo;After me comes a man who is preferred before me, for he was before me.&rsquo;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.1.31"><span class="verse-num">31&nbsp;</span>I didn&rsquo;t know him, but for this reason I came baptizing in water: that he would be revealed to Israel.&rdquo;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.1.32"><span class="verse-num">32&nbsp;</span>John testified, saying, &ldquo;I have seen the Spirit descending like a dove out of heaven, and it remained on him.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.1.33"><span class="verse-num">33&nbsp;</span>I didn&rsquo;t recognize him, but he who sent me to baptize in water, he said to me, &lsquo;On whomever you will see the Spirit descending, and remaining on him, the same is he who baptizes in the Holy Spirit.&rsquo;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.1.34"><span class="verse-num">34&nbsp;</span>I have seen, and have testified that this is the Son of God.&rdquo;</span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="John.1.35"><span class="verse-num">35&nbsp;</span>Again, the next day, John was standing with two of his disciples,</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.1.36"><span class="verse-num">36&nbsp;</span>and he looked at Jesus as he walked, and said, &ldquo;Behold, the Lamb of God!&rdquo;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.1.37"><span class="verse-num">37&nbsp;</span>The two disciples heard him speak, and they followed Jesus.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.1.38"><span class="verse-num">38&nbsp;</span>Jesus turned, and saw them following, and said to them, <span class="woc"> &ldquo;What are you looking for?&rdquo;</span></span>

</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="John.1.39"><span class="verse-num">39&nbsp;</span>He said to them, <span class="woc"> &ldquo;Come, and see.&rdquo;</span></span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="John.1.40"><span class="verse-num">40&nbsp;</span>One of the two who heard John, and followed him, was Andrew, Simon Peter&rsquo;s brother.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.1.41"><span class="verse-num">41&nbsp;</span>He first found his own brother, Simon, and said to him, &ldquo;We have found the Messiah!&rdquo; (which is, being interpreted, Christ<span class="note">+<dfn>&ldquo;Messiah&rdquo; (Hebrew) and &ldquo;Christ&rdquo; (Greek) both mean &ldquo;Anointed One&rdquo;.</dfn></span>).</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.1.42"><span class="verse-num">42&nbsp;</span>He brought him to Jesus. Jesus looked at him, and said, <span class="woc"> &ldquo;You are Simon the son of Jonah. You shall be called Cephas&rdquo;</span> (which is by interpretation, Peter).</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.1.43"><span class="verse-num">43&nbsp;</span>On the next day, he was determined to go out into Galilee, and he found Philip. Jesus said to him, <span class="woc"> &ldquo;Follow me.&rdquo;</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.1.44"><span class="verse-num">44&nbsp;</span>Now Philip was from Bethsaida, of the city of Andrew and Peter.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.1.45"><span class="verse-num">45&nbsp;</span>Philip found Nathanael, and said to him, &ldquo;We have found him, of whom Moses in the law, and the prophets, wrote: Jesus of Nazareth, the son of Joseph.&rdquo;</span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="John.1.46"><span class="verse-num">46&nbsp;</span>Nathanael said to him, &ldquo;Can any good thing come out of Nazareth?&rdquo;</span>

</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="John.1.47"><span class="verse-num">47&nbsp;</span>Jesus saw Nathanael coming to him, and said about him, <span class="woc"> &ldquo;Behold, an Israelite indeed, in whom is no deceit!&rdquo;</span></span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="John.1.48"><span class="verse-num">48&nbsp;</span>Nathanael said to him, &ldquo;How do you know me?&rdquo;</span>

</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="John.1.49"><span class="verse-num">49&nbsp;</span>Nathanael answered him, &ldquo;Rabbi, you are the Son of God! You are King of Israel!&rdquo;</span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="John.1.50"><span class="verse-num">50&nbsp;</span>Jesus answered him, <span class="woc"> &ldquo;Because I told you, &lsquo;I saw you underneath the fig tree,&rsquo; do you believe? You will see greater things than these!&rdquo;</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.1.51"><span class="verse-num">51&nbsp;</span>He said to him, <span class="woc"> &ldquo;Most certainly, I tell you, hereafter you will see heaven opened, and the angels of God ascending and descending on the Son of Man.&rdquo;</span></span>
