<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.2.7"><span class="verse-num">7&nbsp;</span>She gave birth to her firstborn son. She wrapped him in bands of cloth, and laid him in a feeding trough, because there was no room for them in the inn.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.2.8"><span class="verse-num">8&nbsp;</span>There were shepherds in the same country staying in the field, and keeping watch by night over their flock.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.2.9"><span class="verse-num">9&nbsp;</span>Behold, an angel of the Lord stood by them, and the glory of the Lord shone around them, and they were terrified.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.2.10"><span class="verse-num">10&nbsp;</span>The angel said to them, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be afraid, for behold, I bring you good news of great joy which will be to all the people.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.2.11"><span class="verse-num">11&nbsp;</span>For there is born to you, this day, in the city of David, a Savior, who is Christ the Lord.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.2.12"><span class="verse-num">12&nbsp;</span>This is the sign to you: you will find a baby wrapped in strips of cloth, lying in a feeding trough.&rdquo;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.2.13"><span class="verse-num">13&nbsp;</span>Suddenly, there was with the angel a multitude of the heavenly army praising God, and saying,</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.2.14"><span class="verse-num">14&nbsp;</span>&ldquo;Glory to God in the highest,</span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.2.15"><span class="verse-num">15&nbsp;</span>It happened, when the angels went away from them into the sky, that the shepherds said one to another, &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go to Bethlehem, now, and see this thing that has happened, which the Lord has made known to us.&rdquo;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.2.16"><span class="verse-num">16&nbsp;</span>They came with haste, and found both Mary and Joseph, and the baby was lying in the feeding trough.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.2.17"><span class="verse-num">17&nbsp;</span>When they saw it, they publicized widely the saying which was spoken to them about this child.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.2.18"><span class="verse-num">18&nbsp;</span>All who heard it wondered at the things which were spoken to them by the shepherds.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.2.19"><span class="verse-num">19&nbsp;</span>But Mary kept all these sayings, pondering them in her heart.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.2.20"><span class="verse-num">20&nbsp;</span>The shepherds returned, glorifying and praising God for all the things that they had heard and seen, just as it was told them.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.2.37"><span class="verse-num">37&nbsp;</span>and she had been a widow for about eighty-four years), who didn&rsquo;t depart from the temple, worshiping with fastings and petitions night and day.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.2.38"><span class="verse-num">38&nbsp;</span>Coming up at that very hour, she gave thanks to the Lord, and spoke of him to all those who were looking for redemption in Jerusalem.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.2.43"><span class="verse-num">43&nbsp;</span>and when they had fulfilled the days, as they were returning, the boy Jesus stayed behind in Jerusalem. Joseph and his mother didn&rsquo;t know it,</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.2.44"><span class="verse-num">44&nbsp;</span>but supposing him to be in the company, they went a day&rsquo;s journey, and they looked for him among their relatives and acquaintances.</span>
