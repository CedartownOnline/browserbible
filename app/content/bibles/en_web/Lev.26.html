<span class="verse" data-osis="Lev.26.5"><span class="verse-num">5&nbsp;</span>Your threshing shall reach to the vintage, and the vintage shall reach to the sowing time. You shall eat your bread to the full, and dwell in your land safely.</span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="Lev.26.6"><span class="verse-num">6&nbsp;</span>&ldquo;&lsquo;I will give peace in the land, and you shall lie down, and no one will make you afraid. I will remove evil animals out of the land, neither shall the sword go through your land.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Lev.26.7"><span class="verse-num">7&nbsp;</span>You shall chase your enemies, and they shall fall before you by the sword.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Lev.26.30"><span class="verse-num">30&nbsp;</span>I will destroy your high places, and cut down your incense altars, and cast your dead bodies upon the bodies of your idols; and my soul will abhor you.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Lev.26.31"><span class="verse-num">31&nbsp;</span>I will lay your cities waste, and will bring your sanctuaries to desolation. I will not take delight in the sweet fragrance of your offerings.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Lev.26.32"><span class="verse-num">32&nbsp;</span>I will bring the land into desolation; and your enemies that dwell therein will be astonished at it.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Lev.26.33"><span class="verse-num">33&nbsp;</span>I will scatter you among the nations, and I will draw out the sword after you. Your land will be a desolation, and your cities shall be a waste.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Lev.26.34"><span class="verse-num">34&nbsp;</span>Then the land will enjoy its Sabbaths as long as it lies desolate and you are in your enemies&rsquo; land. Even then the land will rest and enjoy its Sabbaths.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Lev.26.35"><span class="verse-num">35&nbsp;</span>As long as it lies desolate it shall have rest, even the rest which it didn&rsquo;t have in your Sabbaths, when you lived on it.</span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="Lev.26.36"><span class="verse-num">36&nbsp;</span>&ldquo;&lsquo;As for those of you who are left, I will send a faintness into their hearts in the lands of their enemies. The sound of a driven leaf will put them to flight; and they shall flee, as one flees from the sword. They will fall when no one pursues.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Lev.26.37"><span class="verse-num">37&nbsp;</span>They will stumble over one another, as it were before the sword, when no one pursues. You will have no power to stand before your enemies.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Lev.26.38"><span class="verse-num">38&nbsp;</span>You will perish among the nations. The land of your enemies will eat you up.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Lev.26.39"><span class="verse-num">39&nbsp;</span>Those of you who are left will pine away in their iniquity in your enemies&rsquo; lands; and also in the iniquities of their fathers they shall pine away with them.</span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="Lev.26.40"><span class="verse-num">40&nbsp;</span>&ldquo;&lsquo;If they confess their iniquity, and the iniquity of their fathers, in their trespass which they trespassed against me, and also that, because they walked contrary to me,</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Lev.26.41"><span class="verse-num">41&nbsp;</span>I also walked contrary to them, and brought them into the land of their enemies; if then their uncircumcised heart is humbled, and they then accept the punishment of their iniquity;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Lev.26.42"><span class="verse-num">42&nbsp;</span>then I will remember my covenant with Jacob; and also my covenant with Isaac, and also my covenant with Abraham; and I will remember the land.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Lev.26.43"><span class="verse-num">43&nbsp;</span>The land also will be left by them, and will enjoy its Sabbaths while it lies desolate without them: and they will accept the punishment of their iniquity; because, even because they rejected my ordinances, and their soul abhorred my statutes.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Lev.26.44"><span class="verse-num">44&nbsp;</span>Yet for all that, when they are in the land of their enemies, I will not reject them, neither will I abhor them, to destroy them utterly, and to break my covenant with them; for I am Yahweh their God;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Lev.26.45"><span class="verse-num">45&nbsp;</span>but I will for their sake remember the covenant of their ancestors, whom I brought out of the land of Egypt in the sight of the nations, that I might be their God. I am Yahweh.&rsquo;&rdquo;</span>
