<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.15.3"><span class="verse-num">3&nbsp;</span>He answered them, <span class="woc"> &ldquo;Why do you also disobey the commandment of God because of your tradition? </span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.15.4"><span class="verse-num">4&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> For God commanded, &lsquo;Honor your father and your mother,&rsquo;</span><span class="cf">+<dfn>Exodus 20:12; Deuteronomy 5:16</dfn></span><span class="woc"> and, &lsquo;He who speaks evil of father or mother, let him be put to death.&rsquo;</span><span class="cf">+<dfn>Exodus 21:17; Leviticus 20:9</dfn></span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.15.5"><span class="verse-num">5&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> But you say, &lsquo;Whoever may tell his father or his mother, &ldquo;Whatever help you might otherwise have gotten from me is a gift devoted to God,&rdquo; </span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.15.6"><span class="verse-num">6&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> he shall not honor his father or mother.&rsquo; You have made the commandment of God void because of your tradition. </span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.15.7"><span class="verse-num">7&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> You hypocrites! Well did Isaiah prophesy of you, saying,</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.15.8"><span class="verse-num">8&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> &lsquo;These people draw near to me with their mouth,</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.15.9"><span class="verse-num">9&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> And in vain do they worship me,</span></span>

<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.15.10"><span class="verse-num">10&nbsp;</span>He summoned the multitude, and said to them, <span class="woc"> &ldquo;Hear, and understand. </span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.15.11"><span class="verse-num">11&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> That which enters into the mouth doesn&rsquo;t defile the man; but that which proceeds out of the mouth, this defiles the man.&rdquo;</span></span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.15.12"><span class="verse-num">12&nbsp;</span>Then the disciples came, and said to him, &ldquo;Do you know that the Pharisees were offended, when they heard this saying?&rdquo;</span>

<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.15.13"><span class="verse-num">13&nbsp;</span>But he answered, <span class="woc"> &ldquo;Every plant which my heavenly Father didn&rsquo;t plant will be uprooted. </span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.15.18"><span class="verse-num">18&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> But the things which proceed out of the mouth come out of the heart, and they defile the man. </span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.15.19"><span class="verse-num">19&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> For out of the heart come evil thoughts, murders, adulteries, sexual sins, thefts, false testimony, and blasphemies. </span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.15.20"><span class="verse-num">20&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> These are the things which defile the man; but to eat with unwashed hands doesn&rsquo;t defile the man.&rdquo;</span></span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.15.25"><span class="verse-num">25&nbsp;</span>But she came and worshiped him, saying, &ldquo;Lord, help me.&rdquo;</span>

<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.15.26"><span class="verse-num">26&nbsp;</span>But he answered, <span class="woc"> &ldquo;It is not appropriate to take the children&rsquo;s bread and throw it to the dogs.&rdquo;</span></span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.15.27"><span class="verse-num">27&nbsp;</span>But she said, &ldquo;Yes, Lord, but even the dogs eat the crumbs which fall from their masters&rsquo; table.&rdquo;</span>

<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.15.29"><span class="verse-num">29&nbsp;</span>Jesus departed there, and came near to the sea of Galilee; and he went up into the mountain, and sat there.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.15.30"><span class="verse-num">30&nbsp;</span>Great multitudes came to him, having with them the lame, blind, mute, maimed, and many others, and they put them down at his feet. He healed them,</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.15.31"><span class="verse-num">31&nbsp;</span>so that the multitude wondered when they saw the mute speaking, injured whole, lame walking, and blind seeing&mdash;and they glorified the God of Israel.</span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.15.32"><span class="verse-num">32&nbsp;</span>Jesus summoned his disciples and said, <span class="woc"> &ldquo;I have compassion on the multitude, because they continue with me now three days and have nothing to eat. I don&rsquo;t want to send them away fasting, or they might faint on the way.&rdquo; </span></span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="Matt.15.33"><span class="verse-num">33&nbsp;</span>The disciples said to him, &ldquo;Where should we get so many loaves in a deserted place as to satisfy so great a multitude?&rdquo;</span>
