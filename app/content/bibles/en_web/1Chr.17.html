<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="1Chr.17.1"><span class="verse-num verse-1">1&nbsp;</span>It happened, when David lived in his house, that David said to Nathan the prophet, &ldquo;Behold, I dwell in a house of cedar, but the ark of the covenant of Yahweh is under curtains.&rdquo;</span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="1Chr.17.2"><span class="verse-num">2&nbsp;</span>Nathan said to David, &ldquo;Do all that is in your heart; for God is with you.&rdquo;</span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="1Chr.17.3"><span class="verse-num">3&nbsp;</span>It happened the same night, that the word of God came to Nathan, saying,</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="1Chr.17.4"><span class="verse-num">4&nbsp;</span>&ldquo;Go and tell David my servant, &lsquo;Thus says Yahweh, &ldquo;You shall not build me a house to dwell in;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="1Chr.17.5"><span class="verse-num">5&nbsp;</span>for I have not lived in a house since the day that I brought up Israel, to this day, but have gone from tent to tent, and from one tent to another.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="1Chr.17.6"><span class="verse-num">6&nbsp;</span>In all places in which I have walked with all Israel, did I speak a word with any of the judges of Israel, whom I commanded to be shepherd of my people, saying, &lsquo;Why have you not built me a house of cedar?&rsquo;&rdquo;&rsquo;</span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="1Chr.17.7"><span class="verse-num">7&nbsp;</span>&ldquo;Now therefore, you shall tell my servant David, &lsquo;Thus says Yahweh of Armies, &ldquo;I took you from the sheep pen, from following the sheep, that you should be prince over my people Israel.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="1Chr.17.8"><span class="verse-num">8&nbsp;</span>I have been with you wherever you have gone, and have cut off all your enemies from before you. I will make you a name, like the name of the great ones who are in the earth.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="1Chr.17.9"><span class="verse-num">9&nbsp;</span>I will appoint a place for my people Israel, and will plant them, that they may dwell in their own place, and be moved no more; neither shall the children of wickedness waste them any more, as at the first,</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="1Chr.17.10"><span class="verse-num">10&nbsp;</span>and from the day that I commanded judges to be over my people Israel; and I will subdue all your enemies. Moreover I tell you that Yahweh will build you a house.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="1Chr.17.11"><span class="verse-num">11&nbsp;</span>It shall happen, when your days are fulfilled that you must go to be with your fathers, that I will set up your seed after you, who shall be of your sons; and I will establish his kingdom.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="1Chr.17.12"><span class="verse-num">12&nbsp;</span>He shall build me a house, and I will establish his throne forever.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="1Chr.17.13"><span class="verse-num">13&nbsp;</span>I will be his father, and he shall be my son. I will not take my loving kindness away from him, as I took it from him that was before you;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="1Chr.17.14"><span class="verse-num">14&nbsp;</span>but I will settle him in my house and in my kingdom forever. His throne shall be established forever.&rdquo;&rsquo;&rdquo;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="1Chr.17.15"><span class="verse-num">15&nbsp;</span>According to all these words, and according to all this vision, so Nathan spoke to David.</span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="1Chr.17.16"><span class="verse-num">16&nbsp;</span>Then David the king went in, and sat before Yahweh; and he said, &ldquo;Who am I, Yahweh God, and what is my house, that you have brought me thus far?</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="1Chr.17.17"><span class="verse-num">17&nbsp;</span>This was a small thing in your eyes, God; but you have spoken of your servant&rsquo;s house for a great while to come, and have respected me according to the estate of a man of high degree, Yahweh God.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="1Chr.17.18"><span class="verse-num">18&nbsp;</span>What can David say yet more to you concerning the honor which is done to your servant? For you know your servant.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="1Chr.17.19"><span class="verse-num">19&nbsp;</span>Yahweh, for your servant&rsquo;s sake, and according to your own heart, you have worked all this greatness, to make known all these great things.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="1Chr.17.20"><span class="verse-num">20&nbsp;</span>Yahweh, there is no one like you, neither is there any God besides you, according to all that we have heard with our ears.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="1Chr.17.21"><span class="verse-num">21&nbsp;</span>What one nation in the earth is like your people Israel, whom God went to redeem to himself for a people, to make you a name by great and awesome things, in driving out nations from before your people, whom you redeem out of Egypt?</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="1Chr.17.22"><span class="verse-num">22&nbsp;</span>For your people Israel you made your own people forever; and you, Yahweh, became their God.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="1Chr.17.23"><span class="verse-num">23&nbsp;</span>Now, Yahweh, let the word that you have spoken concerning your servant, and concerning his house, be established forever, and do as you have spoken.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="1Chr.17.24"><span class="verse-num">24&nbsp;</span>Let your name be established and magnified forever, saying, &lsquo;Yahweh of Armies is the God of Israel, even a God to Israel. The house of David your servant is established before you.&rsquo;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="1Chr.17.25"><span class="verse-num">25&nbsp;</span>For you, my God, have revealed to your servant that you will build him a house. Therefore your servant has found courage to pray before you.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="1Chr.17.26"><span class="verse-num">26&nbsp;</span>Now, Yahweh, you are God, and have promised this good thing to your servant.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="1Chr.17.27"><span class="verse-num">27&nbsp;</span>Now it has pleased you to bless the house of your servant, that it may continue forever before you; for you, Yahweh, have blessed, and it is blessed forever.&rdquo;</span>
