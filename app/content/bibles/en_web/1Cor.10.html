<span class="verse" data-osis="1Cor.10.4"><span class="verse-num">4&nbsp;</span>and all drank the same spiritual drink. For they drank of a spiritual rock that followed them, and the rock was Christ.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="1Cor.10.5"><span class="verse-num">5&nbsp;</span>However with most of them, God was not well pleased, for they were overthrown in the wilderness.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="1Cor.10.7"><span class="verse-num">7&nbsp;</span>Neither be idolaters, as some of them were. As it is written, &ldquo;The people sat down to eat and drink, and rose up to play.&rdquo;\x + Exodus 32:6\x*</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="1Cor.10.8"><span class="verse-num">8&nbsp;</span>Neither let us commit sexual immorality, as some of them committed, and in one day twenty-three thousand fell.</span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="1Cor.10.13"><span class="verse-num">13&nbsp;</span>No temptation has taken you except what is common to man.

<span class="verse" data-osis="1Cor.10.14"><span class="verse-num">14&nbsp;</span>Therefore, my beloved, flee from idolatry.</span>

<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="1Cor.10.19"><span class="verse-num">19&nbsp;</span>What am I saying then? That a thing sacrificed to idols is anything, or that an idol is anything?</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="1Cor.10.20"><span class="verse-num">20&nbsp;</span>But I say that the things which the Gentiles sacrifice, they sacrifice to demons, and not to God, and I don&rsquo;t desire that you would have fellowship with demons.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="1Cor.10.21"><span class="verse-num">21&nbsp;</span>You can&rsquo;t both drink the cup of the Lord and the cup of demons. You can&rsquo;t both partake of the table of the Lord, and of the table of demons.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="1Cor.10.22"><span class="verse-num">22&nbsp;</span>Or do we provoke the Lord to jealousy? Are we stronger than he?</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="1Cor.10.23"><span class="verse-num">23&nbsp;</span>&ldquo;All things are lawful for me,&rdquo; but not all things are profitable. &ldquo;All things are lawful for me,&rdquo; but not all things build up.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="1Cor.10.24"><span class="verse-num">24&nbsp;</span>Let no one seek his own, but each one his neighbor&rsquo;s good.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="1Cor.10.25"><span class="verse-num">25&nbsp;</span>Whatever is sold in the butcher shop, eat, asking no question for the sake of conscience,</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="1Cor.10.26"><span class="verse-num">26&nbsp;</span>for &ldquo;the earth is the Lord&rsquo;s, and its fullness.&rdquo;\x + Psalm 24:1 \x*</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="1Cor.10.27"><span class="verse-num">27&nbsp;</span>But if one of those who don&rsquo;t believe invites you to a meal, and you are inclined to go, eat whatever is set before you, asking no questions for the sake of conscience.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="1Cor.10.28"><span class="verse-num">28&nbsp;</span>But if anyone says to you, &ldquo;This was offered to idols,&rdquo; don&rsquo;t eat it for the sake of the one who told you, and for the sake of conscience.

<span class="verse" data-osis="1Cor.10.29"><span class="verse-num">29&nbsp;</span>Conscience, I say, not your own, but the other&rsquo;s conscience. For why is my liberty judged by another conscience?</span>
