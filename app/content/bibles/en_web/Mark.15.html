<span class="verse" data-osis="Mark.15.1"><span class="verse-num verse-1">1&nbsp;</span>Immediately in the morning the chief priests, with the elders and scribes, and the whole council, held a consultation, and bound Jesus, and carried him away, and delivered him up to Pilate.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Mark.15.2"><span class="verse-num">2&nbsp;</span>Pilate asked him, &ldquo;Are you the King of the Jews?&rdquo;</span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="Mark.15.5"><span class="verse-num">5&nbsp;</span>But Jesus made no further answer, so that Pilate marveled.</span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="Mark.15.6"><span class="verse-num">6&nbsp;</span>Now at the feast he used to release to them one prisoner, whom they asked of him.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Mark.15.7"><span class="verse-num">7&nbsp;</span>There was one called Barabbas, bound with those who had made insurrection, men who in the insurrection had committed murder.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Mark.15.8"><span class="verse-num">8&nbsp;</span>The multitude, crying aloud, began to ask him to do as he always did for them.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Mark.15.9"><span class="verse-num">9&nbsp;</span>Pilate answered them, saying, &ldquo;Do you want me to release to you the King of the Jews?&rdquo;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Mark.15.10"><span class="verse-num">10&nbsp;</span>For he perceived that for envy the chief priests had delivered him up.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Mark.15.11"><span class="verse-num">11&nbsp;</span>But the chief priests stirred up the multitude, that he should release Barabbas to them instead.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Mark.15.12"><span class="verse-num">12&nbsp;</span>Pilate again asked them, &ldquo;What then should I do to him whom you call the King of the Jews?&rdquo;</span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="Mark.15.13"><span class="verse-num">13&nbsp;</span>They cried out again, &ldquo;Crucify him!&rdquo;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Mark.15.15"><span class="verse-num">15&nbsp;</span>Pilate, wishing to please the multitude, released Barabbas to them, and handed over Jesus, when he had flogged him, to be crucified.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Mark.15.16"><span class="verse-num">16&nbsp;</span>The soldiers led him away within the court, which is the Praetorium; and they called together the whole cohort.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Mark.15.17"><span class="verse-num">17&nbsp;</span>They clothed him with purple, and weaving a crown of thorns, they put it on him.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Mark.15.18"><span class="verse-num">18&nbsp;</span>They began to salute him, &ldquo;Hail, King of the Jews!&rdquo;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Mark.15.19"><span class="verse-num">19&nbsp;</span>They struck his head with a reed, and spat on him, and bowing their knees, did homage to him.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Mark.15.20"><span class="verse-num">20&nbsp;</span>When they had mocked him, they took the purple off of him, and put his own garments on him. They led him out to crucify him.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Mark.15.21"><span class="verse-num">21&nbsp;</span>They compelled one passing by, coming from the country, Simon of Cyrene, the father of Alexander and Rufus, to go with them, that he might bear his cross.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Mark.15.22"><span class="verse-num">22&nbsp;</span>They brought him to the place called Golgotha, which is, being interpreted, &ldquo;The place of a skull.&rdquo;</span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="Mark.15.24"><span class="verse-num">24&nbsp;</span>Crucifying him, they parted his garments among them, casting lots on them, what each should take.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Mark.15.25"><span class="verse-num">25&nbsp;</span>It was the third hour,<span class="note">+<dfn>9:00 A. M.</dfn></span> and they crucified him.</span>

<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="Mark.15.29"><span class="verse-num">29&nbsp;</span>Those who passed by blasphemed him, wagging their heads, and saying, &ldquo;Ha! You who destroy the temple, and build it in three days,</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Mark.15.30"><span class="verse-num">30&nbsp;</span>save yourself, and come down from the cross!&rdquo;</span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="Mark.15.31"><span class="verse-num">31&nbsp;</span>Likewise, also the chief priests mocking among themselves with the scribes said, &ldquo;He saved others. He can&rsquo;t save himself.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Mark.15.32"><span class="verse-num">32&nbsp;</span>Let the Christ, the King of Israel, now come down from the cross, that we may see and believe him.<span class="note">+<dfn>TR omits &ldquo;him&rdquo;</dfn></span>&rdquo; Those who were crucified with him insulted him.</span>

<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="Mark.15.36"><span class="verse-num">36&nbsp;</span>One ran, and filling a sponge full of vinegar, put it on a reed, and gave it to him to drink, saying, &ldquo;Let him be. Let&rsquo;s see whether Elijah comes to take him down.&rdquo;</span>
