<span class="verse" data-osis="Rom.2.1"><span class="verse-num verse-1">1&nbsp;</span>Therefore you are without excuse, O man, whoever you are who judge. For in that which you judge another, you condemn yourself. For you who judge practice the same things.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Rom.2.2"><span class="verse-num">2&nbsp;</span>We know that the judgment of God is according to truth against those who practice such things.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Rom.2.3"><span class="verse-num">3&nbsp;</span>Do you think this, O man who judges those who practice such things, and do the same, that you will escape the judgment of God?</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Rom.2.4"><span class="verse-num">4&nbsp;</span>Or do you despise the riches of his goodness, forbearance, and patience, not knowing that the goodness of God leads you to repentance?</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Rom.2.5"><span class="verse-num">5&nbsp;</span>But according to your hardness and unrepentant heart you are treasuring up for yourself wrath in the day of wrath, revelation, and of the righteous judgment of God;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Rom.2.6"><span class="verse-num">6&nbsp;</span>who &ldquo;will pay back to everyone according to their works:&rdquo;\x + Psalm 62:12; Proverbs 24:12\x*</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Rom.2.7"><span class="verse-num">7&nbsp;</span>to those who by patience in well-doing seek for glory, honor, and incorruptibility, eternal life;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Rom.2.8"><span class="verse-num">8&nbsp;</span>but to those who are self-seeking, and don&rsquo;t obey the truth, but obey unrighteousness, will be wrath and indignation,</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Rom.2.9"><span class="verse-num">9&nbsp;</span>oppression and anguish, on every soul of man who works evil, to the Jew first, and also to the Greek.</span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="Rom.2.10"><span class="verse-num">10&nbsp;</span>But glory, honor, and peace go to every man who works good, to the Jew first, and also to the Greek.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Rom.2.11"><span class="verse-num">11&nbsp;</span>For there is no partiality with God.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Rom.2.12"><span class="verse-num">12&nbsp;</span>For as many as have sinned without law will also perish without the law. As many as have sinned under the law will be judged by the law.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Rom.2.13"><span class="verse-num">13&nbsp;</span>For it isn&rsquo;t the hearers of the law who are righteous before God, but the doers of the law will be justified</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Rom.2.14"><span class="verse-num">14&nbsp;</span>(for when Gentiles who don&rsquo;t have the law do by nature the things of the law, these, not having the law, are a law to themselves,</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Rom.2.15"><span class="verse-num">15&nbsp;</span>in that they show the work of the law written in their hearts, their conscience testifying with them, and their thoughts among themselves accusing or else excusing them)</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Rom.2.16"><span class="verse-num">16&nbsp;</span>in the day when God will judge the secrets of men, according to my Good News, by Jesus Christ.</span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="Rom.2.17"><span class="verse-num">17&nbsp;</span>Indeed you bear the name of a Jew, and rest on the law, and glory in God,</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Rom.2.18"><span class="verse-num">18&nbsp;</span>and know his will, and approve the things that are excellent, being instructed out of the law,</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Rom.2.19"><span class="verse-num">19&nbsp;</span>and are confident that you yourself are a guide of the blind, a light to those who are in darkness,</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Rom.2.20"><span class="verse-num">20&nbsp;</span>a corrector of the foolish, a teacher of babies, having in the law the form of knowledge and of the truth.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Rom.2.21"><span class="verse-num">21&nbsp;</span>You therefore who teach another, don&rsquo;t you teach yourself? You who preach that a man shouldn&rsquo;t steal, do you steal?</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Rom.2.22"><span class="verse-num">22&nbsp;</span>You who say a man shouldn&rsquo;t commit adultery. Do you commit adultery? You who abhor idols, do you rob temples?</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Rom.2.23"><span class="verse-num">23&nbsp;</span>You who glory in the law, through your disobedience of the law do you dishonor God?</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Rom.2.24"><span class="verse-num">24&nbsp;</span>For &ldquo;the name of God is blasphemed among the Gentiles because of you,&rdquo;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Rom.2.25"><span class="verse-num">25&nbsp;</span>For circumcision indeed profits, if you are a doer of the law, but if you are a transgressor of the law, your circumcision has become uncircumcision.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Rom.2.26"><span class="verse-num">26&nbsp;</span>If therefore the uncircumcised keep the ordinances of the law, won&rsquo;t his uncircumcision be accounted as circumcision?</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Rom.2.27"><span class="verse-num">27&nbsp;</span>Won&rsquo;t the uncircumcision which is by nature, if it fulfills the law, judge you, who with the letter and circumcision are a transgressor of the law?</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Rom.2.28"><span class="verse-num">28&nbsp;</span>For he is not a Jew who is one outwardly, neither is that circumcision which is outward in the flesh;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Rom.2.29"><span class="verse-num">29&nbsp;</span>but he is a Jew who is one inwardly, and circumcision is that of the heart, in the spirit not in the letter; whose praise is not from men, but from God.</span>
