<span class="verse" data-osis="Num.6.2"><span class="verse-num">2&nbsp;</span>&ldquo;Speak to the children of Israel, and tell them: &lsquo;When either man or woman shall make a special vow, the vow of a Nazirite, to separate himself to Yahweh,</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Num.6.3"><span class="verse-num">3&nbsp;</span>he shall separate himself from wine and strong drink. He shall drink no vinegar of wine, or vinegar of fermented drink, neither shall he drink any juice of grapes, nor eat fresh grapes or dried.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Num.6.4"><span class="verse-num">4&nbsp;</span>All the days of his separation he shall eat nothing that is made of the grapevine, from the seeds even to the skins.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Num.6.5"><span class="verse-num">5&nbsp;</span>&ldquo;&lsquo;All the days of his vow of separation no razor shall come on his head, until the days are fulfilled, in which he separates himself to Yahweh. He shall be holy. He shall let the locks of the hair of his head grow long.</span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="Num.6.6"><span class="verse-num">6&nbsp;</span>&ldquo;&lsquo;All the days that he separates himself to Yahweh he shall not go near a dead body.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Num.6.7"><span class="verse-num">7&nbsp;</span>He shall not make himself unclean for his father, or for his mother, for his brother, or for his sister, when they die; because his separation to God <span class="note">+<dfn>The Hebrew word rendered &ldquo;God&rdquo; is &ldquo;Elohim.&rdquo;</dfn></span> is on his head.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Num.6.8"><span class="verse-num">8&nbsp;</span>All the days of his separation he is holy to Yahweh.</span>

<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="Num.6.9"><span class="verse-num">9&nbsp;</span>&ldquo;&lsquo;If any man dies very suddenly beside him, and he defiles the head of his separation; then he shall shave his head in the day of his cleansing. On the seventh day he shall shave it.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Num.6.10"><span class="verse-num">10&nbsp;</span>On the eighth day he shall bring two turtledoves or two young pigeons to the priest, to the door of the Tent of Meeting.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Num.6.13"><span class="verse-num">13&nbsp;</span>&ldquo;&lsquo;This is the law of the Nazirite: when the days of his separation are fulfilled, he shall be brought to the door of the Tent of Meeting,</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Num.6.14"><span class="verse-num">14&nbsp;</span>and he shall offer his offering to Yahweh, one male lamb a year old without defect for a burnt offering, and one ewe lamb a year old without defect for a sin offering, and one ram without defect for peace offerings,</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Num.6.15"><span class="verse-num">15&nbsp;</span>and a basket of unleavened bread, cakes of fine flour mixed with oil, and unleavened wafers anointed with oil, and their meal offering, and their drink offerings.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Num.6.19"><span class="verse-num">19&nbsp;</span>The priest shall take the boiled shoulder of the ram, and one unleavened cake out of the basket, and one unleavened wafer, and shall put them on the hands of the Nazirite, after he has shaved the head of his separation;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Num.6.20"><span class="verse-num">20&nbsp;</span>and the priest shall wave them for a wave offering before Yahweh. This is holy for the priest, together with the breast that is waved and the thigh that is offered. After that the Nazirite may drink wine.</span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="Num.6.21"><span class="verse-num">21&nbsp;</span>&ldquo;&lsquo;This is the law of the Nazirite who vows, and of his offering to Yahweh for his separation, besides that which he is able to get. According to his vow which he vows, so he must do after the law of his separation.&rsquo;&rdquo;</span>
