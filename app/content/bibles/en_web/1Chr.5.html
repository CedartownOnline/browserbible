<span class="verse" data-osis="1Chr.5.19"><span class="verse-num">19&nbsp;</span>They made war with the Hagrites, with Jetur, and Naphish, and Nodab.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="1Chr.5.20"><span class="verse-num">20&nbsp;</span>They were helped against them, and the Hagrites were delivered into their hand, and all who were with them; for they cried to God in the battle, and he was entreated of them, because they put their trust in him.</span>
