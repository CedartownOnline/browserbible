<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="2Tim.1.3"><span class="verse-num">3&nbsp;</span>I thank God, whom I serve as my forefathers did, with a pure conscience. How unceasing is my memory of you in my petitions, night and day</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="2Tim.1.4"><span class="verse-num">4&nbsp;</span>longing to see you, remembering your tears, that I may be filled with joy;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="2Tim.1.5"><span class="verse-num">5&nbsp;</span>having been reminded of the sincere faith that is in you; which lived first in your grandmother Lois, and your mother Eunice, and, I am persuaded, in you also.</span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="2Tim.1.6"><span class="verse-num">6&nbsp;</span>For this cause, I remind you that you should stir up the gift of God which is in you through the laying on of my hands.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="2Tim.1.7"><span class="verse-num">7&nbsp;</span>For God didn&rsquo;t give us a spirit of fear, but of power, love, and self-control.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="2Tim.1.8"><span class="verse-num">8&nbsp;</span>Therefore don&rsquo;t be ashamed of the testimony of our Lord, nor of me his prisoner; but endure hardship for the Good News according to the power of God,</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="2Tim.1.9"><span class="verse-num">9&nbsp;</span>who saved us and called us with a holy calling, not according to our works, but according to his own purpose and grace, which was given to us in Christ Jesus before times eternal,</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="2Tim.1.10"><span class="verse-num">10&nbsp;</span>but has now been revealed by the appearing of our Savior, Christ Jesus, who abolished death, and brought life and immortality to light through the Good News.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="2Tim.1.11"><span class="verse-num">11&nbsp;</span>For this, I was appointed as a preacher, an apostle, and a teacher of the Gentiles.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="2Tim.1.12"><span class="verse-num">12&nbsp;</span>For this cause I also suffer these things.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="2Tim.1.16"><span class="verse-num">16&nbsp;</span>May the Lord grant mercy to the house of Onesiphorus, for he often refreshed me, and was not ashamed of my chain,</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="2Tim.1.17"><span class="verse-num">17&nbsp;</span>but when he was in Rome, he sought me diligently, and found me</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="2Tim.1.18"><span class="verse-num">18&nbsp;</span>(the Lord grant to him to find the Lord&rsquo;s mercy in that day); and in how many things he served at Ephesus, you know very well.</span>
