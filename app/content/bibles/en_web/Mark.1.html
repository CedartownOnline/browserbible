<span class="verse" data-osis="Mark.1.5"><span class="verse-num">5&nbsp;</span>All the country of Judea and all those of Jerusalem went out to him. They were baptized by him in the Jordan river, confessing their sins.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Mark.1.6"><span class="verse-num">6&nbsp;</span>John was clothed with camel&rsquo;s hair and a leather belt around his waist. He ate locusts and wild honey.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Mark.1.7"><span class="verse-num">7&nbsp;</span>He preached, saying, &ldquo;After me comes he who is mightier than I, the thong of whose sandals I am not worthy to stoop down and loosen.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Mark.1.8"><span class="verse-num">8&nbsp;</span>I baptized you in<span class="note">+<dfn>The Greek word (en) translated here as &ldquo;in&rdquo; could also be translated as &ldquo;with&rdquo; in some contexts.</dfn></span> water, but he will baptize you in the Holy Spirit.&rdquo;</span>

<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="Mark.1.9"><span class="verse-num">9&nbsp;</span>It happened in those days, that Jesus came from Nazareth of Galilee, and was baptized by John in the Jordan.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Mark.1.10"><span class="verse-num">10&nbsp;</span>Immediately coming up from the water, he saw the heavens parting, and the Spirit descending on him like a dove.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Mark.1.11"><span class="verse-num">11&nbsp;</span>A voice came out of the sky, &ldquo;You are my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased.&rdquo;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Mark.1.13"><span class="verse-num">13&nbsp;</span>He was there in the wilderness forty days tempted by Satan. He was with the wild animals; and the angels were serving him.</span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="Mark.1.14"><span class="verse-num">14&nbsp;</span>Now after John was taken into custody, Jesus came into Galilee, preaching the Good News of the Kingdom of God,</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Mark.1.15"><span class="verse-num">15&nbsp;</span>and saying, <span class="woc"> &ldquo;The time is fulfilled, and the Kingdom of God is at hand! Repent, and believe in the Good News.&rdquo;</span></span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="Mark.1.16"><span class="verse-num">16&nbsp;</span>Passing along by the sea of Galilee, he saw Simon and Andrew the brother of Simon casting a net into the sea, for they were fishermen.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Mark.1.17"><span class="verse-num">17&nbsp;</span>Jesus said to them, <span class="woc"> &ldquo;Come after me, and I will make you into fishers for men.&rdquo;</span></span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="Mark.1.18"><span class="verse-num">18&nbsp;</span>Immediately they left their nets, and followed him.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Mark.1.19"><span class="verse-num">19&nbsp;</span>Going on a little further from there, he saw James the son of Zebedee, and John, his brother, who were also in the boat mending the nets.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Mark.1.20"><span class="verse-num">20&nbsp;</span>Immediately he called them, and they left their father, Zebedee, in the boat with the hired servants, and went after him.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Mark.1.21"><span class="verse-num">21&nbsp;</span>They went into Capernaum, and immediately on the Sabbath day he entered into the synagogue and taught.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Mark.1.22"><span class="verse-num">22&nbsp;</span>They were astonished at his teaching, for he taught them as having authority, and not as the scribes.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Mark.1.23"><span class="verse-num">23&nbsp;</span>Immediately there was in their synagogue a man with an unclean spirit, and he cried out,</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Mark.1.24"><span class="verse-num">24&nbsp;</span>saying, &ldquo;Ha! What do we have to do with you, Jesus, you Nazarene? Have you come to destroy us? I know you who you are: the Holy One of God!&rdquo;</span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="Mark.1.25"><span class="verse-num">25&nbsp;</span>Jesus rebuked him, saying, <span class="woc"> &ldquo;Be quiet, and come out of him!&rdquo; </span></span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="Mark.1.26"><span class="verse-num">26&nbsp;</span>The unclean spirit, convulsing him and crying with a loud voice, came out of him.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Mark.1.27"><span class="verse-num">27&nbsp;</span>They were all amazed, so that they questioned among themselves, saying, &ldquo;What is this? A new teaching? For with authority he commands even the unclean spirits, and they obey him!&rdquo;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Mark.1.28"><span class="verse-num">28&nbsp;</span>The report of him went out immediately everywhere into all the region of Galilee and its surrounding area.</span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="Mark.1.29"><span class="verse-num">29&nbsp;</span>Immediately, when they had come out of the synagogue, they came into the house of Simon and Andrew, with James and John.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Mark.1.30"><span class="verse-num">30&nbsp;</span>Now Simon&rsquo;s wife&rsquo;s mother lay sick with a fever, and immediately they told him about her.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Mark.1.31"><span class="verse-num">31&nbsp;</span>He came and took her by the hand, and raised her up. The fever left her, and she served them.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Mark.1.32"><span class="verse-num">32&nbsp;</span>At evening, when the sun had set, they brought to him all who were sick, and those who were possessed by demons.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Mark.1.33"><span class="verse-num">33&nbsp;</span>All the city was gathered together at the door.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Mark.1.34"><span class="verse-num">34&nbsp;</span>He healed many who were sick with various diseases, and cast out many demons. He didn&rsquo;t allow the demons to speak, because they knew him.</span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="Mark.1.35"><span class="verse-num">35&nbsp;</span>Early in the morning, while it was still dark, he rose up and went out, and departed into a deserted place, and prayed there.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Mark.1.36"><span class="verse-num">36&nbsp;</span>Simon and those who were with him followed after him;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Mark.1.37"><span class="verse-num">37&nbsp;</span>and they found him, and told him, &ldquo;Everyone is looking for you.&rdquo;</span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="Mark.1.38"><span class="verse-num">38&nbsp;</span>He said to them, <span class="woc"> &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go elsewhere into the next towns, that I may preach there also, because I came out for this reason.&rdquo;</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Mark.1.39"><span class="verse-num">39&nbsp;</span>He went into their synagogues throughout all Galilee, preaching and casting out demons.</span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="Mark.1.40"><span class="verse-num">40&nbsp;</span>A leper came to him, begging him, kneeling down to him, and saying to him, &ldquo;If you want to, you can make me clean.&rdquo;</span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="Mark.1.41"><span class="verse-num">41&nbsp;</span>Being moved with compassion, he stretched out his hand, and touched him, and said to him, <span class="woc"> &ldquo;I want to. Be made clean.&rdquo;</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Mark.1.42"><span class="verse-num">42&nbsp;</span>When he had said this, immediately the leprosy departed from him, and he was made clean.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Mark.1.43"><span class="verse-num">43&nbsp;</span>He strictly warned him, and immediately sent him out,</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Mark.1.44"><span class="verse-num">44&nbsp;</span>and said to him, <span class="woc"> &ldquo;See you say nothing to anybody, but go show yourself to the priest, and offer for your cleansing the things which Moses commanded, for a testimony to them.&rdquo;</span></span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="Mark.1.45"><span class="verse-num">45&nbsp;</span>But he went out, and began to proclaim it much, and to spread about the matter, so that Jesus could no more openly enter into a city, but was outside in desert places: and they came to him from everywhere.</span>
