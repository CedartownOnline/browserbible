</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="Exod.23.12"><span class="verse-num">12&nbsp;</span>&ldquo;Six days you shall do your work, and on the seventh day you shall rest, that your ox and your donkey may have rest, and the son of your handmaid, and the alien may be refreshed.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Exod.23.21"><span class="verse-num">21&nbsp;</span>Pay attention to him, and listen to his voice. Don&rsquo;t provoke him, for he will not pardon your disobedience, for my name is in him.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Exod.23.22"><span class="verse-num">22&nbsp;</span>But if you indeed listen to his voice, and do all that I speak, then I will be an enemy to your enemies, and an adversary to your adversaries.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Exod.23.23"><span class="verse-num">23&nbsp;</span>For my angel shall go before you, and bring you in to the Amorite, the Hittite, the Perizzite, the Canaanite, the Hivite, and the Jebusite; and I will cut them off.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Exod.23.24"><span class="verse-num">24&nbsp;</span>You shall not bow down to their gods, nor serve them, nor follow their practices, but you shall utterly overthrow them and demolish their pillars.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Exod.23.25"><span class="verse-num">25&nbsp;</span>You shall serve Yahweh your God, and he will bless your bread and your water, and I will take sickness away from your midst.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Exod.23.27"><span class="verse-num">27&nbsp;</span>I will send my terror before you, and will confuse all the people to whom you come, and I will make all your enemies turn their backs to you.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Exod.23.29"><span class="verse-num">29&nbsp;</span>I will not drive them out from before you in one year, lest the land become desolate, and the animals of the field multiply against you.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Exod.23.30"><span class="verse-num">30&nbsp;</span>Little by little I will drive them out from before you, until you have increased and inherit the land.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Exod.23.31"><span class="verse-num">31&nbsp;</span>I will set your border from the Red Sea even to the sea of the Philistines, and from the wilderness to the River; for I will deliver the inhabitants of the land into your hand, and you shall drive them out before you.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Exod.23.32"><span class="verse-num">32&nbsp;</span>You shall make no covenant with them, nor with their gods.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Exod.23.33"><span class="verse-num">33&nbsp;</span>They shall not dwell in your land, lest they make you sin against me, for if you serve their gods, it will surely be a snare to you.&rdquo;</span>
