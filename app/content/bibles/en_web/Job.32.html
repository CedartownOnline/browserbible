<span class="verse" data-osis="Job.32.2"><span class="verse-num">2&nbsp;</span>Then the wrath of Elihu the son of Barachel, the Buzite, of the family of Ram, was kindled against Job. His wrath was kindled because he justified himself rather than God.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Job.32.3"><span class="verse-num">3&nbsp;</span>Also his wrath was kindled against his three friends, because they had found no answer, and yet had condemned Job.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Job.32.10"><span class="verse-num">10&nbsp;</span>Therefore I said, &lsquo;Listen to me;</span>
