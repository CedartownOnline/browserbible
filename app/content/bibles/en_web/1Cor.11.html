<p>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="1Cor.11.1"><span class="verse-num verse-1">1&nbsp;</span>Be imitators of me, even as I also am of Christ.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="1Cor.11.2"><span class="verse-num">2&nbsp;</span>Now I praise you, brothers, that you remember me in all things, and hold firm the traditions, even as I delivered them to you.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="1Cor.11.3"><span class="verse-num">3&nbsp;</span>But I would have you know that the head of every man is Christ, and the head of the woman is the man, and the head of Christ is God.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="1Cor.11.4"><span class="verse-num">4&nbsp;</span>Every man praying or prophesying, having his head covered, dishonors his head.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="1Cor.11.5"><span class="verse-num">5&nbsp;</span>But every woman praying or prophesying with her head unveiled dishonors her head. For it is one and the same thing as if she were shaved.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="1Cor.11.6"><span class="verse-num">6&nbsp;</span>For if a woman is not covered, let her also be shorn. But if it is shameful for a woman to be shorn or shaved, let her be covered.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="1Cor.11.7"><span class="verse-num">7&nbsp;</span>For a man indeed ought not to have his head covered, because he is the image and glory of God, but the woman is the glory of the man.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="1Cor.11.8"><span class="verse-num">8&nbsp;</span>For man is not from woman, but woman from man;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="1Cor.11.9"><span class="verse-num">9&nbsp;</span>for neither was man created for the woman, but woman for the man.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="1Cor.11.10"><span class="verse-num">10&nbsp;</span>For this cause the woman ought to have authority on her head, because of the angels.</span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="1Cor.11.11"><span class="verse-num">11&nbsp;</span>Nevertheless, neither is the woman independent of the man, nor the man independent of the woman, in the Lord.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="1Cor.11.12"><span class="verse-num">12&nbsp;</span>For as woman came from man, so a man also comes through a woman; but all things are from God.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="1Cor.11.13"><span class="verse-num">13&nbsp;</span>Judge for yourselves. Is it appropriate that a woman pray to God unveiled?</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="1Cor.11.14"><span class="verse-num">14&nbsp;</span>Doesn&rsquo;t even nature itself teach you that if a man has long hair, it is a dishonor to him?</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="1Cor.11.15"><span class="verse-num">15&nbsp;</span>But if a woman has long hair, it is a glory to her, for her hair is given to her for a covering.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="1Cor.11.16"><span class="verse-num">16&nbsp;</span>But if any man seems to be contentious, we have no such custom, neither do God&rsquo;s assemblies.</span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="1Cor.11.17"><span class="verse-num">17&nbsp;</span>But in giving you this command, I don&rsquo;t praise you, that you come together not for the better but for the worse.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="1Cor.11.18"><span class="verse-num">18&nbsp;</span>For first of all, when you come together in the assembly, I hear that divisions exist among you, and I partly believe it.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="1Cor.11.19"><span class="verse-num">19&nbsp;</span>For there also must be factions among you, that those who are approved may be revealed among you.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="1Cor.11.20"><span class="verse-num">20&nbsp;</span>When therefore you assemble yourselves together, it is not the Lord&rsquo;s supper that you eat.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="1Cor.11.21"><span class="verse-num">21&nbsp;</span>For in your eating each one takes his own supper first. One is hungry, and another is drunken.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="1Cor.11.22"><span class="verse-num">22&nbsp;</span>What, don&rsquo;t you have houses to eat and to drink in? Or do you despise God&rsquo;s assembly, and put them to shame who don&rsquo;t have? What shall I tell you? Shall I praise you? In this I don&rsquo;t praise you.</span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="1Cor.11.23"><span class="verse-num">23&nbsp;</span>For I received from the Lord that which also I delivered to you, that the Lord Jesus on the night in which he was betrayed took bread.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="1Cor.11.24"><span class="verse-num">24&nbsp;</span>When he had given thanks, he broke it, and said, <span class="woc"> &ldquo;Take, eat. This is my body, which is broken for you. Do this in memory of me.&rdquo;</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="1Cor.11.25"><span class="verse-num">25&nbsp;</span>In the same way he also took the cup, after supper, saying, <span class="woc"> &ldquo;This cup is the new covenant in my blood. Do this, as often as you drink, in memory of me.&rdquo;</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="1Cor.11.26"><span class="verse-num">26&nbsp;</span>For as often as you eat this bread and drink this cup, you proclaim the Lord&rsquo;s death until he comes.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="1Cor.11.27"><span class="verse-num">27&nbsp;</span>Therefore whoever eats this bread or drinks the Lord&rsquo;s cup in a way unworthy of the Lord will be guilty of the body and the blood of the Lord.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="1Cor.11.28"><span class="verse-num">28&nbsp;</span>But let a man examine himself, and so let him eat of the bread, and drink of the cup.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="1Cor.11.29"><span class="verse-num">29&nbsp;</span>For he who eats and drinks in an unworthy way eats and drinks judgment to himself, if he doesn&rsquo;t discern the Lord&rsquo;s body.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="1Cor.11.30"><span class="verse-num">30&nbsp;</span>For this cause many among you are weak and sickly, and not a few sleep.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="1Cor.11.31"><span class="verse-num">31&nbsp;</span>For if we discerned ourselves, we wouldn&rsquo;t be judged.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="1Cor.11.32"><span class="verse-num">32&nbsp;</span>But when we are judged, we are punished by the Lord, that we may not be condemned with the world.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="1Cor.11.33"><span class="verse-num">33&nbsp;</span>Therefore, my brothers, when you come together to eat, wait for one another.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="1Cor.11.34"><span class="verse-num">34&nbsp;</span>But if anyone is hungry, let him eat at home, lest your coming together be for judgment. The rest I will set in order whenever I come.</span>
