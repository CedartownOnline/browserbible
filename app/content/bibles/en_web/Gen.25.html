<span class="verse" data-osis="Gen.25.21"><span class="verse-num">21&nbsp;</span>Isaac entreated Yahweh for his wife, because she was barren. Yahweh was entreated by him, and Rebekah his wife conceived.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Gen.25.22"><span class="verse-num">22&nbsp;</span>The children struggled together within her. She said, &ldquo;If it be so, why do I live?&rdquo; She went to inquire of Yahweh.</span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="Gen.25.24"><span class="verse-num">24&nbsp;</span>When her days to be delivered were fulfilled, behold, there were twins in her womb.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Gen.25.25"><span class="verse-num">25&nbsp;</span>The first came out red all over, like a hairy garment. They named him Esau.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Gen.25.26"><span class="verse-num">26&nbsp;</span>After that, his brother came out, and his hand had hold on Esau&rsquo;s heel. He was named Jacob. Isaac was sixty years old when she bore them.</span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="Gen.25.27"><span class="verse-num">27&nbsp;</span>The boys grew. Esau was a skillful hunter, a man of the field. Jacob was a quiet man, living in tents.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Gen.25.28"><span class="verse-num">28&nbsp;</span>Now Isaac loved Esau, because he ate his venison. Rebekah loved Jacob.</span>
