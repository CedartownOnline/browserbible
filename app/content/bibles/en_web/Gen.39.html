<span class="verse" data-osis="Gen.39.1"><span class="verse-num verse-1">1&nbsp;</span>Joseph was brought down to Egypt. Potiphar, an officer of Pharaoh&rsquo;s, the captain of the guard, an Egyptian, bought him from the hand of the Ishmaelites that had brought him down there.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Gen.39.2"><span class="verse-num">2&nbsp;</span>Yahweh was with Joseph, and he was a prosperous man. He was in the house of his master the Egyptian.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Gen.39.3"><span class="verse-num">3&nbsp;</span>His master saw that Yahweh was with him, and that Yahweh made all that he did prosper in his hand.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Gen.39.4"><span class="verse-num">4&nbsp;</span>Joseph found favor in his sight. He ministered to him, and he made him overseer over his house, and all that he had he put into his hand.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Gen.39.5"><span class="verse-num">5&nbsp;</span>It happened from the time that he made him overseer in his house, and over all that he had, that Yahweh blessed the Egyptian&rsquo;s house for Joseph&rsquo;s sake; and the blessing of Yahweh was on all that he had, in the house and in the field.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Gen.39.6"><span class="verse-num">6&nbsp;</span>He left all that he had in Joseph&rsquo;s hand. He didn&rsquo;t concern himself with anything, except for the food which he ate.</span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="Gen.39.7"><span class="verse-num">7&nbsp;</span>It happened after these things, that his master&rsquo;s wife cast her eyes on Joseph; and she said, &ldquo;Lie with me.&rdquo;</span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="Gen.39.8"><span class="verse-num">8&nbsp;</span>But he refused, and said to his master&rsquo;s wife, &ldquo;Behold, my master doesn&rsquo;t know what is with me in the house, and he has put all that he has into my hand.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Gen.39.9"><span class="verse-num">9&nbsp;</span>He isn&rsquo;t greater in this house than I, neither has he kept back anything from me but you, because you are his wife. How then can I do this great wickedness, and sin against God?&rdquo;</span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="Gen.39.10"><span class="verse-num">10&nbsp;</span>As she spoke to Joseph day by day, he didn&rsquo;t listen to her, to lie by her, or to be with her.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Gen.39.11"><span class="verse-num">11&nbsp;</span>About this time, he went into the house to do his work, and there were none of the men of the house inside.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Gen.39.12"><span class="verse-num">12&nbsp;</span>She caught him by his garment, saying, &ldquo;Lie with me!&rdquo;</span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="Gen.39.13"><span class="verse-num">13&nbsp;</span>When she saw that he had left his garment in her hand, and had run outside,</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Gen.39.14"><span class="verse-num">14&nbsp;</span>she called to the men of her house, and spoke to them, saying, &ldquo;Behold, he has brought in a Hebrew to us to mock us. He came in to me to lie with me, and I cried with a loud voice.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Gen.39.15"><span class="verse-num">15&nbsp;</span>It happened, when he heard that I lifted up my voice and cried, that he left his garment by me, and ran outside.&rdquo;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Gen.39.16"><span class="verse-num">16&nbsp;</span>She laid up his garment by her, until his master came home.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Gen.39.17"><span class="verse-num">17&nbsp;</span>She spoke to him according to these words, saying, &ldquo;The Hebrew servant, whom you have brought to us, came in to me to mock me,</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Gen.39.18"><span class="verse-num">18&nbsp;</span>and it happened, as I lifted up my voice and cried, that he left his garment by me, and ran outside.&rdquo;</span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="Gen.39.19"><span class="verse-num">19&nbsp;</span>It happened, when his master heard the words of his wife, which she spoke to him, saying, &ldquo;This is what your servant did to me,&rdquo; that his wrath was kindled.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Gen.39.20"><span class="verse-num">20&nbsp;</span>Joseph&rsquo;s master took him, and put him into the prison, the place where the king&rsquo;s prisoners were bound, and he was there in custody.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Gen.39.21"><span class="verse-num">21&nbsp;</span>But Yahweh was with Joseph, and showed kindness to him, and gave him favor in the sight of the keeper of the prison.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Gen.39.22"><span class="verse-num">22&nbsp;</span>The keeper of the prison committed to Joseph&rsquo;s hand all the prisoners who were in the prison. Whatever they did there, he was responsible for it.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Gen.39.23"><span class="verse-num">23&nbsp;</span>The keeper of the prison didn&rsquo;t look after anything that was under his hand, because Yahweh was with him; and that which he did, Yahweh made it prosper.</span>
