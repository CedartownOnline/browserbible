<span class="verse" data-osis="Ezek.2.2"><span class="verse-num">2&nbsp;</span>The Spirit entered into me when he spoke to me, and set me on my feet; and I heard him who spoke to me.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Ezek.2.3"><span class="verse-num">3&nbsp;</span>He said to me, Son of man, I send you to the children of Israel, to a nation of rebels who have rebelled against me. They and their fathers have transgressed against me even to this very day.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Ezek.2.4"><span class="verse-num">4&nbsp;</span>The children are impudent and stiff-hearted: I am sending you to them; and you shall tell them, Thus says the Lord<span class="note">+<dfn>The word translated &ldquo;Lord&rdquo; is &ldquo;Adonai.&rdquo;</dfn></span> Yahweh.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Ezek.2.5"><span class="verse-num">5&nbsp;</span>They, whether they will hear, or whether they will forbear, (for they are a rebellious house), yet shall know that there has been a prophet among them.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Ezek.2.7"><span class="verse-num">7&nbsp;</span>You shall speak my words to them, whether they will hear, or whether they will forbear; for they are most rebellious.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Ezek.2.8"><span class="verse-num">8&nbsp;</span>But you, son of man, hear what I tell you; don&rsquo;t be rebellious like that rebellious house: open your mouth, and eat that which I give you.</span>
