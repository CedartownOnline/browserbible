<span class="verse" data-osis="Zech.1.15"><span class="verse-num">15&nbsp;</span>I am very angry with the nations that are at ease; for I was but a little displeased, but they added to the calamity.&rdquo;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Zech.1.16"><span class="verse-num">16&nbsp;</span>Therefore thus says Yahweh: &ldquo;I have returned to Jerusalem with mercy. My house shall be built in it,&rdquo; says Yahweh of Armies, &ldquo;and a line shall be stretched out over Jerusalem.&rdquo;&rsquo;</span>
