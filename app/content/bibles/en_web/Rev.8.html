<span class="verse" data-osis="Rev.8.1"><span class="verse-num verse-1">1&nbsp;</span>When he opened the seventh seal, there was silence in heaven for about half an hour.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Rev.8.2"><span class="verse-num">2&nbsp;</span>I saw the seven angels who stand before God, and seven trumpets were given to them.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Rev.8.3"><span class="verse-num">3&nbsp;</span>Another angel came and stood over the altar, having a golden censer. Much incense was given to him, that he should add it to the prayers of all the saints on the golden altar which was before the throne.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Rev.8.4"><span class="verse-num">4&nbsp;</span>The smoke of the incense, with the prayers of the saints, went up before God out of the angel&rsquo;s hand.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Rev.8.5"><span class="verse-num">5&nbsp;</span>The angel took the censer, and he filled it with the fire of the altar, and threw it on the earth. There followed thunders, sounds, lightnings, and an earthquake.</span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="Rev.8.6"><span class="verse-num">6&nbsp;</span>The seven angels who had the seven trumpets prepared themselves to sound.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Rev.8.7"><span class="verse-num">7&nbsp;</span>The first sounded, and there followed hail and fire, mixed with blood, and they were thrown to the earth. One third of the earth was burnt up,</span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="Rev.8.8"><span class="verse-num">8&nbsp;</span>The second angel sounded, and something like a great burning mountain was thrown into the sea. One third of the sea became blood,</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Rev.8.9"><span class="verse-num">9&nbsp;</span>and one third of the living creatures which were in the sea died. One third of the ships were destroyed.</span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="Rev.8.10"><span class="verse-num">10&nbsp;</span>The third angel sounded, and a great star fell from the sky, burning like a torch, and it fell on one third of the rivers, and on the springs of the waters.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Rev.8.11"><span class="verse-num">11&nbsp;</span>The name of the star is called &ldquo;Wormwood.&rdquo; One third of the waters became wormwood. Many people died from the waters, because they were made bitter.</span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="Rev.8.12"><span class="verse-num">12&nbsp;</span>The fourth angel sounded, and one third of the sun was struck, and one third of the moon, and one third of the stars; so that one third of them would be darkened, and the day wouldn&rsquo;t shine for one third of it, and the night in the same way.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Rev.8.13"><span class="verse-num">13&nbsp;</span>I saw, and I heard an eagle,<span class="note">+<dfn>TR reads &ldquo;angel&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;eagle&rdquo;</dfn></span> flying in mid heaven, saying with a loud voice, &ldquo;Woe! Woe! Woe for those who dwell on the earth, because of the other voices of the trumpets of the three angels, who are yet to sound!&rdquo;</span>
