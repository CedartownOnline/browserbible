<span class="verse" data-osis="Col.1.6"><span class="verse-num">6&nbsp;</span>which has come to you; even as it is in all the world and is bearing fruit and growing, as it does in you also, since the day you heard and knew the grace of God in truth;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Col.1.7"><span class="verse-num">7&nbsp;</span>even as you learned of Epaphras our beloved fellow servant, who is a faithful servant of Christ on our behalf,</span>

<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="Col.1.24"><span class="verse-num">24&nbsp;</span>Now I rejoice in my sufferings for your sake, and fill up on my part that which is lacking of the afflictions of Christ in my flesh for his body&rsquo;s sake, which is the assembly;</span>
