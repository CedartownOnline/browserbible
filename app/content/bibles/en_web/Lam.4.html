<span class="verse" data-osis="Lam.4.3"><span class="verse-num">3&nbsp;</span>Even the jackals draw out the breast, they nurse their young ones:</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Lam.4.4"><span class="verse-num">4&nbsp;</span>The tongue of the nursing child clings to the roof of his mouth for thirst:</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Lam.4.5"><span class="verse-num">5&nbsp;</span>Those who fed delicately are desolate in the streets:</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Lam.4.6"><span class="verse-num">6&nbsp;</span>For the iniquity of the daughter of my people is greater than the sin of Sodom,</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Lam.4.7"><span class="verse-num">7&nbsp;</span>Her nobles were purer than snow, they were whiter than milk;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Lam.4.8"><span class="verse-num">8&nbsp;</span>Their appearance is blacker than a coal; they are not known in the streets:</span>
