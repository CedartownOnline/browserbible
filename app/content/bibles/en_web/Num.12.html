<span class="verse" data-osis="Num.12.1"><span class="verse-num verse-1">1&nbsp;</span>Miriam and Aaron spoke against Moses because of the Cushite woman whom he had married; for he had married a Cushite woman.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Num.12.2"><span class="verse-num">2&nbsp;</span>They said, &ldquo;Has Yahweh indeed spoken only with Moses? Hasn&rsquo;t he spoken also with us?&rdquo; And Yahweh heard it.</span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="Num.12.3"><span class="verse-num">3&nbsp;</span>Now the man Moses was very humble, above all the men who were on the surface of the earth.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Num.12.4"><span class="verse-num">4&nbsp;</span>Yahweh spoke suddenly to Moses, to Aaron, and to Miriam, &ldquo;You three come out to the Tent of Meeting!&rdquo;</span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="Num.12.5"><span class="verse-num">5&nbsp;</span>Yahweh came down in a pillar of cloud, and stood at the door of the Tent, and called Aaron and Miriam; and they both came forward.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Num.12.6"><span class="verse-num">6&nbsp;</span>He said, &ldquo;Now hear my words. If there is a prophet among you, I, Yahweh, will make myself known to him in a vision. I will speak with him in a dream.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Num.12.7"><span class="verse-num">7&nbsp;</span>My servant Moses is not so. He is faithful in all my house.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Num.12.8"><span class="verse-num">8&nbsp;</span>With him, I will speak mouth to mouth, even plainly, and not in riddles; and he shall see Yahweh&rsquo;s form. Why then were you not afraid to speak against my servant, against Moses?&rdquo;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Num.12.9"><span class="verse-num">9&nbsp;</span>Yahweh&rsquo;s anger was kindled against them; and he departed.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Num.12.11"><span class="verse-num">11&nbsp;</span>Aaron said to Moses, &ldquo;Oh, my lord, please don&rsquo;t count this sin against us, in which we have done foolishly, and in which we have sinned.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Num.12.12"><span class="verse-num">12&nbsp;</span>Let her not, I pray, be as one dead, of whom the flesh is half consumed when he comes out of his mother&rsquo;s womb.&rdquo;</span>

Let her be shut up outside of the camp seven days, and after that she shall be brought in again.&rdquo;</span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="Num.12.15"><span class="verse-num">15&nbsp;</span>Miriam was shut up outside of the camp seven days, and the people didn&rsquo;t travel until Miriam was brought in again.</span>
