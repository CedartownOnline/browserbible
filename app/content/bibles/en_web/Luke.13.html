<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.13.2"><span class="verse-num">2&nbsp;</span>Jesus answered them, <span class="woc"> &ldquo;Do you think that these Galileans were worse sinners than all the other Galileans, because they suffered such things? </span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.13.3"><span class="verse-num">3&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> I tell you, no, but unless you repent, you will all perish in the same way. </span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.13.4"><span class="verse-num">4&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> Or those eighteen, on whom the tower in Siloam fell, and killed them; do you think that they were worse offenders than all the men who dwell in Jerusalem? </span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.13.5"><span class="verse-num">5&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> I tell you, no, but, unless you repent, you will all perish in the same way.&rdquo;</span></span>

<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.13.6"><span class="verse-num">6&nbsp;</span>He spoke this parable. <span class="woc"> &ldquo;A certain man had a fig tree planted in his vineyard, and he came seeking fruit on it, and found none. </span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.13.7"><span class="verse-num">7&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> He said to the vine dresser, &lsquo;Behold, these three years I have come looking for fruit on this fig tree, and found none. Cut it down. Why does it waste the soil?&rsquo; </span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.13.8"><span class="verse-num">8&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> He answered, &lsquo;Lord, leave it alone this year also, until I dig around it, and fertilize it. </span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.13.9"><span class="verse-num">9&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> If it bears fruit, fine; but if not, after that, you can cut it down.&rsquo;&rdquo;</span></span>

<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.13.10"><span class="verse-num">10&nbsp;</span>He was teaching in one of the synagogues on the Sabbath day.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.13.11"><span class="verse-num">11&nbsp;</span>Behold, there was a woman who had a spirit of infirmity eighteen years, and she was bent over, and could in no way straighten herself up.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.13.12"><span class="verse-num">12&nbsp;</span>When Jesus saw her, he called her, and said to her, <span class="woc"> &ldquo;Woman, you are freed from your infirmity.&rdquo;</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.13.13"><span class="verse-num">13&nbsp;</span>He laid his hands on her, and immediately she stood up straight, and glorified God.</span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.13.14"><span class="verse-num">14&nbsp;</span>The ruler of the synagogue, being indignant because Jesus had healed on the Sabbath, said to the multitude, &ldquo;There are six days in which men ought to work. Therefore come on those days and be healed, and not on the Sabbath day!&rdquo;</span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.13.15"><span class="verse-num">15&nbsp;</span>Therefore the Lord answered him, <span class="woc"> &ldquo;You hypocrites! Doesn&rsquo;t each one of you free his ox or his donkey from the stall on the Sabbath, and lead him away to water? </span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.13.16"><span class="verse-num">16&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> Ought not this woman, being a daughter of Abraham, whom Satan had bound eighteen long years, be freed from this bondage on the Sabbath day?&rdquo; </span></span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.13.17"><span class="verse-num">17&nbsp;</span>As he said these things, all his adversaries were disappointed, and all the multitude rejoiced for all the glorious things that were done by him.</span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.13.18"><span class="verse-num">18&nbsp;</span>He said, <span class="woc"> &ldquo;What is the Kingdom of God like? To what shall I compare it? </span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.13.19"><span class="verse-num">19&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> It is like a grain of mustard seed, which a man took, and put in his own garden. It grew, and became a large tree, and the birds of the sky lodged in its branches.&rdquo;</span></span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.13.20"><span class="verse-num">20&nbsp;</span>Again he said, <span class="woc"> &ldquo;To what shall I compare the Kingdom of God? </span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.13.21"><span class="verse-num">21&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> It is like yeast, which a woman took and hid in three measures </span><span class="note">+<dfn>literally, three sata. 3 sata is about 39 litres or a bit more than a bushel</dfn></span><span class="woc"> of flour, until it was all leavened.&rdquo;</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.13.25"><span class="verse-num">25&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> When once the master of the house has risen up, and has shut the door, and you begin to stand outside, and to knock at the door, saying, &lsquo;Lord, Lord, open to us!&rsquo; then he will answer and tell you, &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t know you or where you come from.&rsquo; </span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.13.26"><span class="verse-num">26&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> Then you will begin to say, &lsquo;We ate and drank in your presence, and you taught in our streets.&rsquo; </span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.13.27"><span class="verse-num">27&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> He will say, &lsquo;I tell you, I don&rsquo;t know where you come from. Depart from me, all you workers of iniquity.&rsquo; </span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.13.28"><span class="verse-num">28&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> There will be weeping and gnashing of teeth, when you see Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and all the prophets, in the Kingdom of God, and yourselves being thrown outside. </span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.13.29"><span class="verse-num">29&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> They will come from the east, west, north, and south, and will sit down in the Kingdom of God. </span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.13.30"><span class="verse-num">30&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> Behold, there are some who are last who will be first, and there are some who are first who will be last.&rdquo;</span></span>

<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.13.31"><span class="verse-num">31&nbsp;</span>On that same day, some Pharisees came, saying to him, &ldquo;Get out of here, and go away, for Herod wants to kill you.&rdquo;</span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.13.32"><span class="verse-num">32&nbsp;</span>He said to them, <span class="woc"> &ldquo;Go and tell that fox, &lsquo;Behold, I cast out demons and perform cures today and tomorrow, and the third day I complete my mission. </span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.13.33"><span class="verse-num">33&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> Nevertheless I must go on my way today and tomorrow and the next day, for it can&rsquo;t be that a prophet perish outside of Jerusalem.&rsquo;</span></span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.13.34"><span class="verse-num">34&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> &ldquo;Jerusalem, Jerusalem, that kills the prophets, and stones those who are sent to her!
