<span class="verse" data-osis="Gen.27.22"><span class="verse-num">22&nbsp;</span>Jacob went near to Isaac his father. He felt him, and said, &ldquo;The voice is Jacob&rsquo;s voice, but the hands are the hands of Esau.&rdquo;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Gen.27.23"><span class="verse-num">23&nbsp;</span>He didn&rsquo;t recognize him, because his hands were hairy, like his brother, Esau&rsquo;s hands. So he blessed him.</span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="Gen.27.30"><span class="verse-num">30&nbsp;</span>It happened, as soon as Isaac had made an end of blessing Jacob, and Jacob had just gone out from the presence of Isaac his father, that Esau his brother came in from his hunting.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Gen.27.31"><span class="verse-num">31&nbsp;</span>He also made savory food, and brought it to his father. He said to his father, &ldquo;Let my father arise, and eat of his son&rsquo;s venison, that your soul may bless me.&rdquo;</span>

<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="Gen.27.35"><span class="verse-num">35&nbsp;</span>He said, &ldquo;Your brother came with deceit, and has taken away your blessing.&rdquo;</span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="Gen.27.36"><span class="verse-num">36&nbsp;</span>He said, &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t he rightly named Jacob? For he has supplanted me these two times. He took away my birthright. See, now he has taken away my blessing.&rdquo; He said, &ldquo;Haven&rsquo;t you reserved a blessing for me?&rdquo;</span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="Gen.27.37"><span class="verse-num">37&nbsp;</span>Isaac answered Esau, &ldquo;Behold, I have made him your lord, and all his brothers have I given to him for servants. With grain and new wine have I sustained him. What then will I do for you, my son?&rdquo;</span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="Gen.27.38"><span class="verse-num">38&nbsp;</span>Esau said to his father, &ldquo;Have you but one blessing, my father? Bless me, even me also, my father.&rdquo; Esau lifted up his voice, and wept.</span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="Gen.27.41"><span class="verse-num">41&nbsp;</span>Esau hated Jacob because of the blessing with which his father blessed him. Esau said in his heart, &ldquo;The days of mourning for my father are at hand. Then I will kill my brother Jacob.&rdquo;</span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="Gen.27.42"><span class="verse-num">42&nbsp;</span>The words of Esau, her elder son, were told to Rebekah. She sent and called Jacob, her younger son, and said to him, &ldquo;Behold, your brother Esau comforts himself about you by planning to kill you.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Gen.27.43"><span class="verse-num">43&nbsp;</span>Now therefore, my son, obey my voice. Arise, flee to Laban, my brother, in Haran.</span>
