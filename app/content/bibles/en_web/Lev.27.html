<span class="verse" data-osis="Lev.27.5"><span class="verse-num">5&nbsp;</span>If the person is from five years old even to twenty years old, then your valuation shall be for a male twenty shekels, and for a female ten shekels.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Lev.27.6"><span class="verse-num">6&nbsp;</span>If the person is from a month old even to five years old, then your valuation shall be for a male five shekels of silver, and for a female your valuation shall be three shekels of silver.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Lev.27.7"><span class="verse-num">7&nbsp;</span>If the person is from sixty years old and upward; if he is a male, then your valuation shall be fifteen shekels, and for a female ten shekels.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Lev.27.8"><span class="verse-num">8&nbsp;</span>But if he is poorer than your valuation, then he shall be set before the priest, and the priest shall assign a value to him. The priest shall assign a value according to his ability to pay.</span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="Lev.27.9"><span class="verse-num">9&nbsp;</span>&ldquo;&lsquo;If it is an animal, of which men offer an offering to Yahweh, all that any man gives of such to Yahweh becomes holy.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Lev.27.10"><span class="verse-num">10&nbsp;</span>He shall not alter it, nor change it, a good for a bad, or a bad for a good: and if he shall at all change animal for animal, then both it and that for which it is changed shall be holy.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Lev.27.11"><span class="verse-num">11&nbsp;</span>If it is any unclean animal, of which they do not offer as an offering to Yahweh, then he shall set the animal before the priest;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Lev.27.12"><span class="verse-num">12&nbsp;</span>and the priest shall value it, whether it is good or bad. As you the priest values it, so shall it be.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Lev.27.13"><span class="verse-num">13&nbsp;</span>But if he will indeed redeem it, then he shall add the fifth part of it to its valuation.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Lev.27.14"><span class="verse-num">14&nbsp;</span>&ldquo;&lsquo;When a man dedicates his house to be holy to Yahweh, then the priest shall evaluate it, whether it is good or bad: as the priest shall evaluate it, so shall it stand.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Lev.27.15"><span class="verse-num">15&nbsp;</span>If he who dedicates it will redeem his house, then he shall add the fifth part of the money of your valuation to it, and it shall be his.</span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="Lev.27.16"><span class="verse-num">16&nbsp;</span>&ldquo;&lsquo;If a man dedicates to Yahweh part of the field of his possession, then your valuation shall be according to the seed for it.

<span class="verse" data-osis="Lev.27.21"><span class="verse-num">21&nbsp;</span>but the field, when it goes out in the Jubilee, shall be holy to Yahweh, as a devoted field. It shall be owned by the priests.</span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="Lev.27.22"><span class="verse-num">22&nbsp;</span>&ldquo;&lsquo;If he dedicates a field to Yahweh which he has bought, which is not of the field of his possession,</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Lev.27.23"><span class="verse-num">23&nbsp;</span>then the priest shall reckon to him the worth of your valuation up to the Year of Jubilee; and he shall give your valuation on that day, as a holy thing to Yahweh.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Lev.27.24"><span class="verse-num">24&nbsp;</span>In the Year of Jubilee the field shall return to him from whom it was bought, even to him to whom the possession of the land belongs.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Lev.27.27"><span class="verse-num">27&nbsp;</span>If it is an unclean animal, then he shall buy it back according to your valuation, and shall add to it the fifth part of it; or if it isn&rsquo;t redeemed, then it shall be sold according to your valuation.</span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="Lev.27.28"><span class="verse-num">28&nbsp;</span>&ldquo;&lsquo;Notwithstanding, no devoted thing, that a man shall devote to Yahweh of all that he has, whether of man or animal, or of the field of his possession, shall be sold or redeemed: every devoted thing is most holy to Yahweh.</span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="Lev.27.29"><span class="verse-num">29&nbsp;</span>&ldquo;&lsquo;No one devoted, who shall be devoted from among men, shall be ransomed; he shall surely be put to death.</span>

<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="Lev.27.30"><span class="verse-num">30&nbsp;</span>&ldquo;&lsquo;All the tithe of the land, whether of the seed of the land or of the fruit of the trees, is Yahweh&rsquo;s. It is holy to Yahweh.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Lev.27.31"><span class="verse-num">31&nbsp;</span>If a man redeems anything of his tithe, he shall add a fifth part to it.</span>
