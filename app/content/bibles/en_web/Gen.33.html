<span class="verse" data-osis="Gen.33.1"><span class="verse-num verse-1">1&nbsp;</span>Jacob lifted up his eyes, and looked, and, behold, Esau was coming, and with him four hundred men. He divided the children between Leah, Rachel, and the two handmaids.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Gen.33.2"><span class="verse-num">2&nbsp;</span>He put the handmaids and their children in front, Leah and her children after, and Rachel and Joseph at the rear.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Gen.33.3"><span class="verse-num">3&nbsp;</span>He himself passed over in front of them, and bowed himself to the ground seven times, until he came near to his brother.</span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="Gen.33.4"><span class="verse-num">4&nbsp;</span>Esau ran to meet him, embraced him, fell on his neck, kissed him, and they wept.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Gen.33.5"><span class="verse-num">5&nbsp;</span>He lifted up his eyes, and saw the women and the children; and said, &ldquo;Who are these with you?&rdquo;</span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="Gen.33.6"><span class="verse-num">6&nbsp;</span>Then the handmaids came near with their children, and they bowed themselves.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Gen.33.7"><span class="verse-num">7&nbsp;</span>Leah also and her children came near, and bowed themselves. After them, Joseph came near with Rachel, and they bowed themselves.</span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="Gen.33.8"><span class="verse-num">8&nbsp;</span>Esau said, &ldquo;What do you mean by all this company which I met?&rdquo;</span>

</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="Gen.33.9"><span class="verse-num">9&nbsp;</span>Esau said, &ldquo;I have enough, my brother; let that which you have be yours.&rdquo;</span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="Gen.33.10"><span class="verse-num">10&nbsp;</span>Jacob said, &ldquo;Please, no, if I have now found favor in your sight, then receive my present at my hand, because I have seen your face, as one sees the face of God, and you were pleased with me.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Gen.33.11"><span class="verse-num">11&nbsp;</span>Please take the gift that I brought to you, because God has dealt graciously with me, and because I have enough.&rdquo; He urged him, and he took it.</span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="Gen.33.12"><span class="verse-num">12&nbsp;</span>Esau said, &ldquo;Let us take our journey, and let us go, and I will go before you.&rdquo;</span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="Gen.33.13"><span class="verse-num">13&nbsp;</span>Jacob said to him, &ldquo;My lord knows that the children are tender, and that the flocks and herds with me have their young, and if they overdrive them one day, all the flocks will die.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Gen.33.14"><span class="verse-num">14&nbsp;</span>Please let my lord pass over before his servant, and I will lead on gently, according to the pace of the livestock that are before me and according to the pace of the children, until I come to my lord to Seir.&rdquo;</span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="Gen.33.15"><span class="verse-num">15&nbsp;</span>Esau said, &ldquo;Let me now leave with you some of the folk who are with me.&rdquo;</span>

</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="Gen.33.16"><span class="verse-num">16&nbsp;</span>So Esau returned that day on his way to Seir.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Gen.33.17"><span class="verse-num">17&nbsp;</span>Jacob traveled to Succoth, built himself a house, and made shelters for his livestock. Therefore the name of the place is called Succoth.<span class="note">+<dfn>succoth means shelters or booths.</dfn></span></span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="Gen.33.18"><span class="verse-num">18&nbsp;</span>Jacob came in peace to the city of Shechem, which is in the land of Canaan, when he came from Paddan Aram; and encamped before the city.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Gen.33.19"><span class="verse-num">19&nbsp;</span>He bought the parcel of ground where he had spread his tent, at the hand of the children of Hamor, Shechem&rsquo;s father, for one hundred pieces of money.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Gen.33.20"><span class="verse-num">20&nbsp;</span>He erected an altar there, and called it El Elohe Israel.<span class="note">+<dfn>El Elohe Israel means &ldquo;God, the God of Israel&rdquo; or &ldquo;The God of Israel is mighty.&rdquo;</dfn></span></span>
