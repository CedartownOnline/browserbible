<span class="verse" data-osis="John.20.1"><span class="verse-num verse-1">1&nbsp;</span>Now on the first day of the week, Mary Magdalene went early, while it was still dark, to the tomb, and saw the stone taken away from the tomb.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.20.2"><span class="verse-num">2&nbsp;</span>Therefore she ran and came to Simon Peter, and to the other disciple whom Jesus loved, and said to them, &ldquo;They have taken away the Lord out of the tomb, and we don&rsquo;t know where they have laid him!&rdquo;</span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="John.20.3"><span class="verse-num">3&nbsp;</span>Therefore Peter and the other disciple went out, and they went toward the tomb.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.20.4"><span class="verse-num">4&nbsp;</span>They both ran together. The other disciple outran Peter, and came to the tomb first.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.20.5"><span class="verse-num">5&nbsp;</span>Stooping and looking in, he saw the linen cloths lying, yet he didn&rsquo;t enter in.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.20.6"><span class="verse-num">6&nbsp;</span>Then Simon Peter came, following him, and entered into the tomb. He saw the linen cloths lying,</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.20.7"><span class="verse-num">7&nbsp;</span>and the cloth that had been on his head, not lying with the linen cloths, but rolled up in a place by itself.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.20.8"><span class="verse-num">8&nbsp;</span>So then the other disciple who came first to the tomb also entered in, and he saw and believed.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.20.9"><span class="verse-num">9&nbsp;</span>For as yet they didn&rsquo;t know the Scripture, that he must rise from the dead.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.20.10"><span class="verse-num">10&nbsp;</span>So the disciples went away again to their own homes.</span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="John.20.11"><span class="verse-num">11&nbsp;</span>But Mary was standing outside at the tomb weeping. So, as she wept, she stooped and looked into the tomb,</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.20.12"><span class="verse-num">12&nbsp;</span>and she saw two angels in white sitting, one at the head, and one at the feet, where the body of Jesus had lain.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.20.13"><span class="verse-num">13&nbsp;</span>They told her, &ldquo;Woman, why are you weeping?&rdquo;</span>

<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="John.20.14"><span class="verse-num">14&nbsp;</span>When she had said this, she turned around and saw Jesus standing, and didn&rsquo;t know that it was Jesus.</span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="John.20.15"><span class="verse-num">15&nbsp;</span>Jesus said to her, <span class="woc"> &ldquo;Woman, why are you weeping? Who are you looking for?&rdquo;</span></span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="John.20.20"><span class="verse-num">20&nbsp;</span>When he had said this, he showed them his hands and his side. The disciples therefore were glad when they saw the Lord.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.20.21"><span class="verse-num">21&nbsp;</span>Jesus therefore said to them again, <span class="woc"> &ldquo;Peace be to you. As the Father has sent me, even so I send you.&rdquo;</span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="John.20.22"><span class="verse-num">22&nbsp;</span>When he had said this, he breathed on them, and said to them, <span class="woc"> &ldquo;Receive the Holy Spirit! </span></span>
