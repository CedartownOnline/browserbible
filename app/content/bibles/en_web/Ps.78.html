<span class="verse Ps_78_5" data-osis="Ps.78.5"><span class="verse-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span>For he established a testimony in Jacob,</span>
<span class="verse Ps_78_6" data-osis="Ps.78.6"><span class="verse-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span>that the generation to come might know, even the children who should be born;</span>

<span class="verse Ps_78_9" data-osis="Ps.78.9"><span class="verse-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span>The children of Ephraim, being armed and carrying bows,</span>
<span class="verse Ps_78_10" data-osis="Ps.78.10"><span class="verse-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span>They didn&rsquo;t keep God&rsquo;s covenant,</span>
<span class="verse Ps_78_11" data-osis="Ps.78.11"><span class="verse-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span>They forgot his doings,</span>
<span class="verse Ps_78_12" data-osis="Ps.78.12"><span class="verse-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span>He did marvelous things in the sight of their fathers,</span>
<span class="verse Ps_78_13" data-osis="Ps.78.13"><span class="verse-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span>He split the sea, and caused them to pass through.</span>
<span class="verse Ps_78_14" data-osis="Ps.78.14"><span class="verse-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span>In the daytime he also led them with a cloud,</span>
<span class="verse Ps_78_15" data-osis="Ps.78.15"><span class="verse-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span>He split rocks in the wilderness,</span>
<span class="verse Ps_78_16" data-osis="Ps.78.16"><span class="verse-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span>He brought streams also out of the rock,</span>
<span class="verse Ps_78_17" data-osis="Ps.78.17"><span class="verse-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span>Yet they still went on to sin against him,</span>
<span class="verse Ps_78_18" data-osis="Ps.78.18"><span class="verse-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span>They tempted God in their heart</span>
<span class="verse Ps_78_19" data-osis="Ps.78.19"><span class="verse-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span>Yes, they spoke against God.</span>
<span class="verse Ps_78_20" data-osis="Ps.78.20"><span class="verse-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span>Behold, he struck the rock, so that waters gushed out,</span>

<span class="verse Ps_78_22" data-osis="Ps.78.22"><span class="verse-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span>because they didn&rsquo;t believe in God,</span>
<span class="verse Ps_78_23" data-osis="Ps.78.23"><span class="verse-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span>Yet he commanded the skies above,</span>
<span class="verse Ps_78_24" data-osis="Ps.78.24"><span class="verse-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span>He rained down manna on them to eat,</span>

<span class="verse Ps_78_28" data-osis="Ps.78.28"><span class="verse-num v-28">28&nbsp;</span>He let them fall in the midst of their camp,</span>
<span class="verse Ps_78_29" data-osis="Ps.78.29"><span class="verse-num v-29">29&nbsp;</span>So they ate, and were well filled.</span>
<span class="verse Ps_78_30" data-osis="Ps.78.30"><span class="verse-num v-30">30&nbsp;</span>They didn&rsquo;t turn from their cravings.</span>
<span class="verse Ps_78_31" data-osis="Ps.78.31"><span class="verse-num v-31">31&nbsp;</span>when the anger of God went up against them,</span>
<span class="verse Ps_78_32" data-osis="Ps.78.32"><span class="verse-num v-32">32&nbsp;</span>For all this they still sinned,</span>
<span class="verse Ps_78_33" data-osis="Ps.78.33"><span class="verse-num v-33">33&nbsp;</span>Therefore he consumed their days in vanity,</span>
<span class="verse Ps_78_34" data-osis="Ps.78.34"><span class="verse-num v-34">34&nbsp;</span>When he killed them, then they inquired after him.</span>
<span class="verse Ps_78_35" data-osis="Ps.78.35"><span class="verse-num v-35">35&nbsp;</span>They remembered that God was their rock,</span>
<span class="verse Ps_78_36" data-osis="Ps.78.36"><span class="verse-num v-36">36&nbsp;</span>But they flattered him with their mouth,</span>
<span class="verse Ps_78_37" data-osis="Ps.78.37"><span class="verse-num v-37">37&nbsp;</span>For their heart was not right with him,</span>
<span class="verse Ps_78_38" data-osis="Ps.78.38"><span class="verse-num v-38">38&nbsp;</span>But he, being merciful, forgave iniquity, and didn&rsquo;t destroy them.</span>
<span class="verse Ps_78_39" data-osis="Ps.78.39"><span class="verse-num v-39">39&nbsp;</span>He remembered that they were but flesh,</span>
<span class="verse Ps_78_40" data-osis="Ps.78.40"><span class="verse-num v-40">40&nbsp;</span>How often they rebelled against him in the wilderness,</span>
<span class="verse Ps_78_41" data-osis="Ps.78.41"><span class="verse-num v-41">41&nbsp;</span>They turned again and tempted God,</span>
<span class="verse Ps_78_42" data-osis="Ps.78.42"><span class="verse-num v-42">42&nbsp;</span>They didn&rsquo;t remember his hand,</span>
<span class="verse Ps_78_43" data-osis="Ps.78.43"><span class="verse-num v-43">43&nbsp;</span>how he set his signs in Egypt,</span>
<span class="verse Ps_78_44" data-osis="Ps.78.44"><span class="verse-num v-44">44&nbsp;</span>he turned their rivers into blood,</span>
<span class="verse Ps_78_45" data-osis="Ps.78.45"><span class="verse-num v-45">45&nbsp;</span>He sent among them swarms of flies, which devoured them;</span>
<span class="verse Ps_78_46" data-osis="Ps.78.46"><span class="verse-num v-46">46&nbsp;</span>He gave also their increase to the caterpillar,</span>
<span class="verse Ps_78_47" data-osis="Ps.78.47"><span class="verse-num v-47">47&nbsp;</span>He destroyed their vines with hail,</span>
<span class="verse Ps_78_48" data-osis="Ps.78.48"><span class="verse-num v-48">48&nbsp;</span>He gave over their livestock also to the hail,</span>
<span class="verse Ps_78_49" data-osis="Ps.78.49"><span class="verse-num v-49">49&nbsp;</span>He threw on them the fierceness of his anger,</span>
<span class="verse Ps_78_50" data-osis="Ps.78.50"><span class="verse-num v-50">50&nbsp;</span>He made a path for his anger.</span>
<span class="verse Ps_78_51" data-osis="Ps.78.51"><span class="verse-num v-51">51&nbsp;</span>and struck all the firstborn in Egypt,</span>
<span class="verse Ps_78_52" data-osis="Ps.78.52"><span class="verse-num v-52">52&nbsp;</span>But he led out his own people like sheep,</span>
<span class="verse Ps_78_53" data-osis="Ps.78.53"><span class="verse-num v-53">53&nbsp;</span>He led them safely, so that they weren&rsquo;t afraid,</span>
<span class="verse Ps_78_54" data-osis="Ps.78.54"><span class="verse-num v-54">54&nbsp;</span>He brought them to the border of his sanctuary,</span>
<span class="verse Ps_78_55" data-osis="Ps.78.55"><span class="verse-num v-55">55&nbsp;</span>He also drove out the nations before them,</span>
<span class="verse Ps_78_56" data-osis="Ps.78.56"><span class="verse-num v-56">56&nbsp;</span>Yet they tempted and rebelled against the Most High God,</span>
<span class="verse Ps_78_57" data-osis="Ps.78.57"><span class="verse-num v-57">57&nbsp;</span>but turned back, and dealt treacherously like their fathers.</span>
<span class="verse Ps_78_58" data-osis="Ps.78.58"><span class="verse-num v-58">58&nbsp;</span>For they provoked him to anger with their high places,</span>
<span class="verse Ps_78_59" data-osis="Ps.78.59"><span class="verse-num v-59">59&nbsp;</span>When God heard this, he was angry,</span>
<span class="verse Ps_78_60" data-osis="Ps.78.60"><span class="verse-num v-60">60&nbsp;</span>So that he abandoned the tent of Shiloh,</span>
<span class="verse Ps_78_61" data-osis="Ps.78.61"><span class="verse-num v-61">61&nbsp;</span>and delivered his strength into captivity,</span>
<span class="verse Ps_78_62" data-osis="Ps.78.62"><span class="verse-num v-62">62&nbsp;</span>He also gave his people over to the sword,</span>
<span class="verse Ps_78_63" data-osis="Ps.78.63"><span class="verse-num v-63">63&nbsp;</span>Fire devoured their young men.</span>
<span class="verse Ps_78_64" data-osis="Ps.78.64"><span class="verse-num v-64">64&nbsp;</span>Their priests fell by the sword,</span>
<span class="verse Ps_78_65" data-osis="Ps.78.65"><span class="verse-num v-65">65&nbsp;</span>Then the Lord awakened as one out of sleep,</span>
<span class="verse Ps_78_66" data-osis="Ps.78.66"><span class="verse-num v-66">66&nbsp;</span>He struck his adversaries backward.</span>
<span class="verse Ps_78_67" data-osis="Ps.78.67"><span class="verse-num v-67">67&nbsp;</span>Moreover he rejected the tent of Joseph,</span>
<span class="verse Ps_78_68" data-osis="Ps.78.68"><span class="verse-num v-68">68&nbsp;</span>But chose the tribe of Judah,</span>
<span class="verse Ps_78_69" data-osis="Ps.78.69"><span class="verse-num v-69">69&nbsp;</span>He built his sanctuary like the heights,</span>
<span class="verse Ps_78_70" data-osis="Ps.78.70"><span class="verse-num v-70">70&nbsp;</span>He also chose David his servant,</span>
<span class="verse Ps_78_71" data-osis="Ps.78.71"><span class="verse-num v-71">71&nbsp;</span>from following the ewes that have their young,</span>
<span class="verse Ps_78_72" data-osis="Ps.78.72"><span class="verse-num v-72">72&nbsp;</span>So he was their shepherd according to the integrity of his heart,</span>
