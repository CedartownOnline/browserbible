<span class="verse" data-osis="Rev.21.7"><span class="verse-num">7&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> He who overcomes, I will give him these things. I will be his God, and he will be my son. </span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Rev.21.9"><span class="verse-num">9&nbsp;</span>One of the seven angels who had the seven bowls, who were loaded with the seven last plagues came, and he spoke with me, saying, &ldquo;Come here. I will show you the wife, the Lamb&rsquo;s bride.&rdquo;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Rev.21.10"><span class="verse-num">10&nbsp;</span>He carried me away in the Spirit to a great and high mountain, and showed me the holy city, Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven from God,</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Rev.21.11"><span class="verse-num">11&nbsp;</span>having the glory of God. Her light was like a most precious stone, as if it were a jasper stone, clear as crystal;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Rev.21.15"><span class="verse-num">15&nbsp;</span>He who spoke with me had for a measure, a golden reed, to measure the city, its gates, and its walls.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Rev.21.16"><span class="verse-num">16&nbsp;</span>The city is square, and its length is as great as its breadth. He measured the city with the reed, Twelve thousand twelve stadia<span class="note">+<dfn>12,012 stadia = or 2,221 kilometers or 1,380 miles. TR reads 12,000 stadia instead of 12,012 stadia.</dfn></span>. Its length, breadth, and height are equal.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Rev.21.17"><span class="verse-num">17&nbsp;</span>Its wall is one hundred forty-four cubits,<span class="note">+<dfn>144 cubits is about 65.8 meters or 216 feet</dfn></span> by the measure of a man, that is, of an angel.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Rev.21.18"><span class="verse-num">18&nbsp;</span>The construction of its wall was jasper. The city was pure gold, like pure glass.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Rev.21.19"><span class="verse-num">19&nbsp;</span>The foundations of the city&rsquo;s wall were adorned with all kinds of precious stones.

<span class="verse" data-osis="Rev.21.21"><span class="verse-num">21&nbsp;</span>The twelve gates were twelve pearls. Each one of the gates was made of one pearl. The street of the city was pure gold, like transparent glass.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Rev.21.22"><span class="verse-num">22&nbsp;</span>I saw no temple in it, for the Lord God, the Almighty, and the Lamb, are its temple.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Rev.21.23"><span class="verse-num">23&nbsp;</span>The city has no need for the sun, neither of the moon, to shine, for the very glory of God illuminated it, and its lamp is the Lamb.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Rev.21.24"><span class="verse-num">24&nbsp;</span>The nations will walk in its light. The kings of the earth bring the glory and honor of the nations into it.</span>
