<span class="verse" data-osis="Acts.8.1"><span class="verse-num verse-1">1&nbsp;</span>Saul was consenting to his death. A great persecution arose against the assembly which was in Jerusalem in that day. They were all scattered abroad throughout the regions of Judea and Samaria, except for the apostles.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Acts.8.2"><span class="verse-num">2&nbsp;</span>Devout men buried Stephen, and lamented greatly over him.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Acts.8.3"><span class="verse-num">3&nbsp;</span>But Saul ravaged the assembly, entering into every house, and dragged both men and women off to prison.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Acts.8.4"><span class="verse-num">4&nbsp;</span>Therefore those who were scattered abroad went around preaching the word.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Acts.8.5"><span class="verse-num">5&nbsp;</span>Philip went down to the city of Samaria, and proclaimed to them the Christ.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Acts.8.6"><span class="verse-num">6&nbsp;</span>The multitudes listened with one accord to the things that were spoken by Philip, when they heard and saw the signs which he did.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Acts.8.7"><span class="verse-num">7&nbsp;</span>For unclean spirits came out of many of those who had them. They came out, crying with a loud voice. Many who had been paralyzed and lame were healed.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Acts.8.8"><span class="verse-num">8&nbsp;</span>There was great joy in that city.</span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="Acts.8.9"><span class="verse-num">9&nbsp;</span>But there was a certain man, Simon by name, who used to practice sorcery in the city, and amazed the people of Samaria, making himself out to be some great one,</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Acts.8.10"><span class="verse-num">10&nbsp;</span>to whom they all listened, from the least to the greatest, saying, &ldquo;This man is that great power of God.&rdquo;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Acts.8.11"><span class="verse-num">11&nbsp;</span>They listened to him, because for a long time he had amazed them with his sorceries.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Acts.8.12"><span class="verse-num">12&nbsp;</span>But when they believed Philip preaching good news concerning the Kingdom of God and the name of Jesus Christ, they were baptized, both men and women.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Acts.8.13"><span class="verse-num">13&nbsp;</span>Simon himself also believed. Being baptized, he continued with Philip. Seeing signs and great miracles occurring, he was amazed.</span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="Acts.8.14"><span class="verse-num">14&nbsp;</span>Now when the apostles who were at Jerusalem heard that Samaria had received the word of God, they sent Peter and John to them,</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Acts.8.15"><span class="verse-num">15&nbsp;</span>who, when they had come down, prayed for them, that they might receive the Holy Spirit;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Acts.8.16"><span class="verse-num">16&nbsp;</span>for as yet he had fallen on none of them. They had only been baptized in the name of Christ Jesus.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Acts.8.17"><span class="verse-num">17&nbsp;</span>Then they laid their hands on them, and they received the Holy Spirit.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Acts.8.18"><span class="verse-num">18&nbsp;</span>Now when Simon saw that the Holy Spirit was given through the laying on of the apostles&rsquo; hands, he offered them money,</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Acts.8.19"><span class="verse-num">19&nbsp;</span>saying, &ldquo;Give me also this power, that whomever I lay my hands on may receive the Holy Spirit.&rdquo;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Acts.8.20"><span class="verse-num">20&nbsp;</span>But Peter said to him, &ldquo;May your silver perish with you, because you thought you could obtain the gift of God with money!</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Acts.8.21"><span class="verse-num">21&nbsp;</span>You have neither part nor lot in this matter, for your heart isn&rsquo;t right before God.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Acts.8.22"><span class="verse-num">22&nbsp;</span>Repent therefore of this, your wickedness, and ask God if perhaps the thought of your heart may be forgiven you.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Acts.8.23"><span class="verse-num">23&nbsp;</span>For I see that you are in the gall of bitterness and in the bondage of iniquity.&rdquo;</span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="Acts.8.24"><span class="verse-num">24&nbsp;</span>Simon answered, &ldquo;Pray for me to the Lord, that none of the things which you have spoken happen to me.&rdquo;</span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="Acts.8.25"><span class="verse-num">25&nbsp;</span>They therefore, when they had testified and spoken the word of the Lord, returned to Jerusalem, and preached the Good News to many villages of the Samaritans.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Acts.8.26"><span class="verse-num">26&nbsp;</span>But an angel of the Lord spoke to Philip, saying, &ldquo;Arise, and go toward the south to the way that goes down from Jerusalem to Gaza. This is a desert.&rdquo;</span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="Acts.8.27"><span class="verse-num">27&nbsp;</span>He arose and went; and behold, there was a man of Ethiopia, a eunuch of great authority under Candace, queen of the Ethiopians, who was over all her treasure, who had come to Jerusalem to worship.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Acts.8.28"><span class="verse-num">28&nbsp;</span>He was returning and sitting in his chariot, and was reading the prophet Isaiah.</span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="Acts.8.29"><span class="verse-num">29&nbsp;</span>The Spirit said to Philip, &ldquo;Go near, and join yourself to this chariot.&rdquo;</span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="Acts.8.30"><span class="verse-num">30&nbsp;</span>Philip ran to him, and heard him reading Isaiah the prophet, and said, &ldquo;Do you understand what you are reading?&rdquo;</span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="Acts.8.31"><span class="verse-num">31&nbsp;</span>He said, &ldquo;How can I, unless someone explains it to me?&rdquo; He begged Philip to come up and sit with him.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Acts.8.32"><span class="verse-num">32&nbsp;</span>Now the passage of the Scripture which he was reading was this,</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Acts.8.33"><span class="verse-num">33&nbsp;</span>In his humiliation, his judgment was taken away.</span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="Acts.8.34"><span class="verse-num">34&nbsp;</span>The eunuch answered Philip, &ldquo;Who is the prophet talking about? About himself, or about someone else?&rdquo;</span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="Acts.8.35"><span class="verse-num">35&nbsp;</span>Philip opened his mouth, and beginning from this Scripture, preached to him Jesus.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Acts.8.36"><span class="verse-num">36&nbsp;</span>As they went on the way, they came to some water, and the eunuch said, &ldquo;Behold, here is water. What is keeping me from being baptized?&rdquo;</span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="Acts.8.37"><span class="verse-num">37&nbsp;</span><span class="note">+<dfn>TR adds &ldquo;Philip said, &lsquo;If you believe with all your heart, you may.&rsquo; He answered, &lsquo;I believe that Jesus Christ is the Son of God.&rsquo;&rdquo;</dfn></span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Acts.8.38"><span class="verse-num">38&nbsp;</span>He commanded the chariot to stand still, and they both went down into the water, both Philip and the eunuch, and he baptized him.</span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="Acts.8.39"><span class="verse-num">39&nbsp;</span>When they came up out of the water, the Spirit of the Lord caught Philip away, and the eunuch didn&rsquo;t see him any more, for he went on his way rejoicing.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Acts.8.40"><span class="verse-num">40&nbsp;</span>But Philip was found at Azotus. Passing through, he preached the Good News to all the cities, until he came to Caesarea.</span>
