<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="Judg.4.1"><span class="verse-num verse-1">1&nbsp;</span>The children of Israel again did that which was evil in the sight of Yahweh, when Ehud was dead.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Judg.4.2"><span class="verse-num">2&nbsp;</span>Yahweh sold them into the hand of Jabin king of Canaan, who reigned in Hazor; the captain of whose army was Sisera, who lived in Harosheth of the Gentiles.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Judg.4.3"><span class="verse-num">3&nbsp;</span>The children of Israel cried to Yahweh: for he had nine hundred chariots of iron; and twenty years he mightily oppressed the children of Israel.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Judg.4.4"><span class="verse-num">4&nbsp;</span>Now Deborah, a prophetess, the wife of Lappidoth, she judged Israel at that time.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Judg.4.5"><span class="verse-num">5&nbsp;</span>She lived under the palm tree of Deborah between Ramah and Bethel in the hill country of Ephraim: and the children of Israel came up to her for judgment.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Judg.4.6"><span class="verse-num">6&nbsp;</span>She sent and called Barak the son of Abinoam out of Kedesh Naphtali, and said to him, &ldquo;Hasn&rsquo;t Yahweh, the God of Israel, commanded, &lsquo;Go and draw to Mount Tabor, and take with you ten thousand men of the children of Naphtali and of the children of Zebulun?</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Judg.4.7"><span class="verse-num">7&nbsp;</span>I will draw to you, to the river Kishon, Sisera, the captain of Jabin&rsquo;s army, with his chariots and his multitude; and I will deliver him into your hand.&rsquo;&rdquo;</span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="Judg.4.8"><span class="verse-num">8&nbsp;</span>Barak said to her, &ldquo;If you will go with me, then I will go; but if you will not go with me, I will not go.&rdquo;</span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="Judg.4.9"><span class="verse-num">9&nbsp;</span>She said, &ldquo;I will surely go with you: nevertheless, the journey that you take shall not be for your honor; for Yahweh will sell Sisera into the hand of a woman.&rdquo; Deborah arose, and went with Barak to Kedesh.</span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="Judg.4.10"><span class="verse-num">10&nbsp;</span>Barak called Zebulun and Naphtali together to Kedesh; and there went up ten thousand men at his feet: and Deborah went up with him.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Judg.4.11"><span class="verse-num">11&nbsp;</span>Now Heber the Kenite had separated himself from the Kenites, even from the children of Hobab the brother-in-law of Moses, and had pitched his tent as far as the oak in Zaanannim, which is by Kedesh.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Judg.4.12"><span class="verse-num">12&nbsp;</span>They told Sisera that Barak the son of Abinoam was gone up to Mount Tabor.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Judg.4.13"><span class="verse-num">13&nbsp;</span>Sisera gathered together all his chariots, even nine hundred chariots of iron, and all the people who were with him, from Harosheth of the Gentiles, to the river Kishon.</span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="Judg.4.14"><span class="verse-num">14&nbsp;</span>Deborah said to Barak, &ldquo;Go; for this is the day in which Yahweh has delivered Sisera into your hand. Hasn&rsquo;t Yahweh gone out before you?&rdquo; So Barak went down from Mount Tabor, and ten thousand men after him.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Judg.4.15"><span class="verse-num">15&nbsp;</span>Yahweh confused Sisera, and all his chariots, and all his army, with the edge of the sword before Barak; and Sisera alighted from his chariot, and fled away on his feet.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Judg.4.16"><span class="verse-num">16&nbsp;</span>But Barak pursued after the chariots, and after the army, to Harosheth of the Gentiles: and all the army of Sisera fell by the edge of the sword; there was not a man left.</span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="Judg.4.17"><span class="verse-num">17&nbsp;</span>However Sisera fled away on his feet to the tent of Jael the wife of Heber the Kenite; for there was peace between Jabin the king of Hazor and the house of Heber the Kenite.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Judg.4.18"><span class="verse-num">18&nbsp;</span>Jael went out to meet Sisera, and said to him, &ldquo;Turn in, my lord, turn in to me; don&rsquo;t be afraid.&rdquo; He came in to her into the tent, and she covered him with a rug.</span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="Judg.4.19"><span class="verse-num">19&nbsp;</span>He said to her, &ldquo;Please give me a little water to drink; for I am thirsty.&rdquo;</span>

</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="Judg.4.20"><span class="verse-num">20&nbsp;</span>He said to her, &ldquo;Stand in the door of the tent, and it shall be, when any man comes and inquires of you, and says, &lsquo;Is there any man here?&rsquo; that you shall say, &lsquo;No.&rsquo;&rdquo;</span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="Judg.4.21"><span class="verse-num">21&nbsp;</span>Then Jael Heber&rsquo;s wife took a tent peg, and took a hammer in her hand, and went softly to him, and struck the pin into his temples, and it pierced through into the ground; for he was in a deep sleep; so he swooned and died.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Judg.4.22"><span class="verse-num">22&nbsp;</span>Behold, as Barak pursued Sisera, Jael came out to meet him, and said to him, &ldquo;Come, and I will show you the man whom you seek.&rdquo; He came to her; and behold, Sisera lay dead, and the tent peg was in his temples.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Judg.4.23"><span class="verse-num">23&nbsp;</span>So God subdued on that day Jabin the king of Canaan before the children of Israel.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Judg.4.24"><span class="verse-num">24&nbsp;</span>The hand of the children of Israel prevailed more and more against Jabin the king of Canaan, until they had destroyed Jabin king of Canaan.</span>
