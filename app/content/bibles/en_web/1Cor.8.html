<span class="verse" data-osis="1Cor.8.1"><span class="verse-num verse-1">1&nbsp;</span>Now concerning things sacrificed to idols: We know that we all have knowledge. Knowledge puffs up, but love builds up.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="1Cor.8.2"><span class="verse-num">2&nbsp;</span>But if anyone thinks that he knows anything, he doesn&rsquo;t yet know as he ought to know.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="1Cor.8.3"><span class="verse-num">3&nbsp;</span>But if anyone loves God, the same is known by him.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="1Cor.8.4"><span class="verse-num">4&nbsp;</span>Therefore concerning the eating of things sacrificed to idols, we know that no idol is anything in the world, and that there is no other God but one.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="1Cor.8.5"><span class="verse-num">5&nbsp;</span>For though there are things that are called &ldquo;gods,&rdquo; whether in the heavens or on earth; as there are many &ldquo;gods&rdquo; and many &ldquo;lords&rdquo;;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="1Cor.8.6"><span class="verse-num">6&nbsp;</span>yet to us there is one God, the Father, of whom are all things, and we for him; and one Lord, Jesus Christ, through whom are all things, and we live through him.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="1Cor.8.7"><span class="verse-num">7&nbsp;</span>However, that knowledge isn&rsquo;t in all men. But some, with consciousness of the idol until now, eat as of a thing sacrificed to an idol, and their conscience, being weak, is defiled.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="1Cor.8.8"><span class="verse-num">8&nbsp;</span>But food will not commend us to God. For neither, if we don&rsquo;t eat, are we the worse; nor, if we eat, are we the better.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="1Cor.8.9"><span class="verse-num">9&nbsp;</span>But be careful that by no means does this liberty of yours become a stumbling block to the weak.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="1Cor.8.10"><span class="verse-num">10&nbsp;</span>For if a man sees you who have knowledge sitting in an idol&rsquo;s temple, won&rsquo;t his conscience, if he is weak, be emboldened to eat things sacrificed to idols?</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="1Cor.8.11"><span class="verse-num">11&nbsp;</span>And through your knowledge, he who is weak perishes, the brother for whose sake Christ died.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="1Cor.8.12"><span class="verse-num">12&nbsp;</span>Thus, sinning against the brothers, and wounding their conscience when it is weak, you sin against Christ.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="1Cor.8.13"><span class="verse-num">13&nbsp;</span>Therefore if food causes my brother to stumble, I will eat no meat forever more, that I don&rsquo;t cause my brother to stumble.</span>
