<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.16.2"><span class="verse-num">2&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> He called him, and said to him, &lsquo;What is this that I hear about you? Give an accounting of your management, for you can no longer be manager.&rsquo; </span></span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.16.3"><span class="verse-num">3&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> &ldquo;The manager said within himself, &lsquo;What will I do, seeing that my lord is taking away the management position from me? I don&rsquo;t have strength to dig. I am ashamed to beg. </span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.16.4"><span class="verse-num">4&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> I know what I will do, so that when I am removed from management, they may receive me into their houses.&rsquo; </span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.16.5"><span class="verse-num">5&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> Calling each one of his lord&rsquo;s debtors to him, he said to the first, &lsquo;How much do you owe to my lord?&rsquo; </span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.16.6"><span class="verse-num">6&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> He said, &lsquo;A hundred batos<span class="note">+<dfn>100 batos is about 395 litres or 104 U.

<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.16.7"><span class="verse-num">7&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> Then he said to another, &lsquo;How much do you owe?&rsquo; He said, &lsquo;A hundred cors<span class="note">+<dfn>100 cors = about 3,910 litres or 600 bushels.</dfn></span>of wheat.&rsquo; He said to him, &lsquo;Take your bill, and write eighty.&rsquo;</span></span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.16.8"><span class="verse-num">8&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> &ldquo;His lord commended the dishonest manager because he had done wisely, for the children of this world are, in their own generation, wiser than the children of the light. </span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.16.9"><span class="verse-num">9&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> I tell you, make for yourselves friends by means of unrighteous mammon, so that when you fail, they may receive you into the eternal tents. </span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.16.10"><span class="verse-num">10&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> He who is faithful in a very little is faithful also in much. He who is dishonest in a very little is also dishonest in much. </span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.16.11"><span class="verse-num">11&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> If therefore you have not been faithful in the unrighteous mammon, who will commit to your trust the true riches? </span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.16.12"><span class="verse-num">12&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> If you have not been faithful in that which is another&rsquo;s, who will give you that which is your own? </span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.16.13"><span class="verse-num">13&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> No servant can serve two masters, for either he will hate the one, and love the other; or else he will hold to one, and despise the other. You aren&rsquo;t able to serve God and Mammon<span class="note">+<dfn>&ldquo;Mammon&rdquo; refers to riches or a false god of wealth.</dfn></span>.&rdquo;</span></span>

For that which is exalted among men is an abomination in the sight of God. </span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.16.16"><span class="verse-num">16&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> The law and the prophets were until John. From that time the Good News of the Kingdom of God is preached, and everyone is forcing his way into it. </span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.16.17"><span class="verse-num">17&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> But it is easier for heaven and earth to pass away, than for one tiny stroke of a pen in the law to fall. </span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.16.18"><span class="verse-num">18&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> Everyone who divorces his wife, and marries another, commits adultery. He who marries one who is divorced from a husband commits adultery. </span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.16.21"><span class="verse-num">21&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> and desiring to be fed with the crumbs that fell from the rich man&rsquo;s table. Yes, even the dogs came and licked his sores. </span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.16.22"><span class="verse-num">22&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> It happened that the beggar died, and that he was carried away by the angels to Abraham&rsquo;s bosom. The rich man also died, and was buried. </span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.16.24"><span class="verse-num">24&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> He cried and said, &lsquo;Father Abraham, have mercy on me, and send Lazarus, that he may dip the tip of his finger in water, and cool my tongue! For I am in anguish in this flame.&rsquo;</span></span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.16.25"><span class="verse-num">25&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> &ldquo;But Abraham said, &lsquo;Son, remember that you, in your lifetime, received your good things, and Lazarus, in the same way, bad things. But now here he is comforted and you are in anguish. </span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.16.26"><span class="verse-num">26&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> Besides all this, between us and you there is a great gulf fixed, that those who want to pass from here to you are not able, and that no one may cross over from there to us.&rsquo;</span></span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.16.27"><span class="verse-num">27&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> &ldquo;He said, &lsquo;I ask you therefore, father, that you would send him to my father&rsquo;s house; </span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Luke.16.28"><span class="verse-num">28&nbsp;</span><span class="woc"> for I have five brothers, that he may testify to them, so they won&rsquo;t also come into this place of torment.&rsquo;</span></span>
