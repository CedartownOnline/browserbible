<span class="verse" data-osis="Ezek.3.1"><span class="verse-num verse-1">1&nbsp;</span>He said to me, Son of man, eat that which you find. Eat this scroll, and go, speak to the house of Israel.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Ezek.3.2"><span class="verse-num">2&nbsp;</span>So I opened my mouth, and he caused me to eat the scroll.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Ezek.3.3"><span class="verse-num">3&nbsp;</span>He said to me, Son of man, cause your belly to eat, and fill your bowels with this scroll that I give you. Then I ate it; and it was as sweet as honey in my mouth.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Ezek.3.4"><span class="verse-num">4&nbsp;</span>He said to me, Son of man, go to the house of Israel, and speak my words to them.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Ezek.3.5"><span class="verse-num">5&nbsp;</span>For you are not sent to a people of a strange speech and of a hard language, but to the house of Israel;</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Ezek.3.6"><span class="verse-num">6&nbsp;</span>not to many peoples of a strange speech and of a hard language, whose words you can not understand. Surely, if I sent you to them, they would listen to you.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Ezek.3.7"><span class="verse-num">7&nbsp;</span>But the house of Israel will not listen to you; for they will not listen to me: for all the house of Israel are obstinate<span class="note">+<dfn>Literally, have a hard forehead</dfn></span> and hard-hearted.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Ezek.3.8"><span class="verse-num">8&nbsp;</span>Behold, I have made your face hard against their faces, and your forehead hard against their foreheads.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Ezek.3.9"><span class="verse-num">9&nbsp;</span>As an adamant harder than flint have I made your forehead: don&rsquo;t be afraid of them, neither be dismayed at their looks, though they are a rebellious house.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Ezek.3.10"><span class="verse-num">10&nbsp;</span>Moreover he said to me, Son of man, all my words that I shall speak to you receive in your heart, and hear with your ears.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Ezek.3.11"><span class="verse-num">11&nbsp;</span>Go to them of the captivity, to the children of your people, and speak to them, and tell them, Thus says the Lord Yahweh; whether they will hear, or whether they will forbear.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Ezek.3.12"><span class="verse-num">12&nbsp;</span>Then the Spirit lifted me up, and I heard behind me the voice of a great rushing, saying, Blessed be Yahweh&rsquo;s glory from his place.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Ezek.3.13"><span class="verse-num">13&nbsp;</span>I heard the noise of the wings of the living creatures as they touched one another, and the noise of the wheels beside them, even the noise of a great rushing.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Ezek.3.14"><span class="verse-num">14&nbsp;</span>So the Spirit lifted me up, and took me away; and I went in bitterness, in the heat of my spirit; and the hand of Yahweh was strong on me.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Ezek.3.15"><span class="verse-num">15&nbsp;</span>Then I came to them of the captivity at Tel Aviv, that lived by the river Chebar, and to where they lived; and I sat there overwhelmed among them seven days.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Ezek.3.16"><span class="verse-num">16&nbsp;</span>It happened at the end of seven days, that the word of Yahweh came to me, saying,</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Ezek.3.17"><span class="verse-num">17&nbsp;</span>Son of man, I have made you a watchman to the house of Israel: therefore hear the word from my mouth, and give them warning from me.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Ezek.3.18"><span class="verse-num">18&nbsp;</span>When I tell the wicked, You shall surely die; and you give him no warning, nor speak to warn the wicked from his wicked way, to save his life; the same wicked man shall die in his iniquity; but his blood will I require at your hand.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Ezek.3.19"><span class="verse-num">19&nbsp;</span>Yet if you warn the wicked, and he doesn&rsquo;t turn from his wickedness, nor from his wicked way, he shall die in his iniquity; but you have delivered your soul.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Ezek.3.20"><span class="verse-num">20&nbsp;</span>Again, when a righteous man does turn from his righteousness, and commit iniquity, and I lay a stumbling block before him, he shall die: because you have not given him warning, he shall die in his sin, and his righteous deeds which he has done shall not be remembered; but his blood will I require at your hand.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Ezek.3.21"><span class="verse-num">21&nbsp;</span>Nevertheless if you warn the righteous man, that the righteous not sin, and he does not sin, he shall surely live, because he took warning; and you have delivered your soul.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Ezek.3.22"><span class="verse-num">22&nbsp;</span>The hand of Yahweh was there on me; and he said to me, Arise, go out into the plain, and I will there talk with you.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Ezek.3.23"><span class="verse-num">23&nbsp;</span>Then I arose, and went out into the plain: and behold, Yahweh&rsquo;s glory stood there, as the glory which I saw by the river Chebar; and I fell on my face.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Ezek.3.24"><span class="verse-num">24&nbsp;</span>Then the Spirit entered into me, and set me on my feet; and he spoke with me, and said to me, Go, shut yourself inside your house.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Ezek.3.25"><span class="verse-num">25&nbsp;</span>But you, son of man, behold, they shall lay bands on you, and shall bind you with them, and you shall not go out among them:</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Ezek.3.26"><span class="verse-num">26&nbsp;</span>and I will make your tongue stick to the roof of your mouth, that you shall be mute, and shall not be to them a reprover; for they are a rebellious house.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Ezek.3.27"><span class="verse-num">27&nbsp;</span>But when I speak with you, I will open your mouth, and you shall tell them, Thus says the Lord Yahweh: He who hears, let him hear; and he who forbears, let him forbear: for they are a rebellious house.</span>
