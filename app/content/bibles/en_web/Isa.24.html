<span class="verse" data-osis="Isa.24.1"><span class="verse-num verse-1">1&nbsp;</span>Behold, Yahweh makes the earth empty, makes it waste, turns it upside down, and scatters its inhabitants.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Isa.24.2"><span class="verse-num">2&nbsp;</span>It will be as with the people, so with the priest; as with the servant, so with his master; as with the maid, so with her mistress; as with the buyer, so with the seller; as with the creditor, so with the debtor; as with the taker of interest, so with the giver of interest.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Isa.24.3"><span class="verse-num">3&nbsp;</span>The earth will be utterly emptied and utterly laid waste; for Yahweh has spoken this word.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Isa.24.4"><span class="verse-num">4&nbsp;</span>The earth mourns and fades away. The world languishes and fades away. The lofty people of the earth languish.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Isa.24.5"><span class="verse-num">5&nbsp;</span>The earth also is polluted under its inhabitants, because they have transgressed the laws, violated the statutes, and broken the everlasting covenant.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Isa.24.6"><span class="verse-num">6&nbsp;</span>Therefore the curse has devoured the earth, and those who dwell therein are found guilty. Therefore the inhabitants of the earth are burned, and few men left.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Isa.24.7"><span class="verse-num">7&nbsp;</span>The new wine mourns. The vine languishes. All the merry-hearted sigh.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Isa.24.8"><span class="verse-num">8&nbsp;</span>The mirth of tambourines ceases. The sound of those who rejoice ends. The joy of the harp ceases.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Isa.24.9"><span class="verse-num">9&nbsp;</span>They will not drink wine with a song. Strong drink will be bitter to those who drink it.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Isa.24.10"><span class="verse-num">10&nbsp;</span>The confused city is broken down. Every house is shut up, that no man may come in.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Isa.24.11"><span class="verse-num">11&nbsp;</span>There is a crying in the streets because of the wine. All joy is darkened. The mirth of the land is gone.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Isa.24.12"><span class="verse-num">12&nbsp;</span>The city is left in desolation, and the gate is struck with destruction.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Isa.24.13"><span class="verse-num">13&nbsp;</span>For it will be so in the midst of the earth among the peoples, as the shaking of an olive tree, as the gleanings when the vintage is done.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Isa.24.14"><span class="verse-num">14&nbsp;</span>These shall lift up their voice. They will shout for the majesty of Yahweh. They cry aloud from the sea.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Isa.24.15"><span class="verse-num">15&nbsp;</span>Therefore glorify Yahweh in the east, even the name of Yahweh, the God of Israel, in the islands of the sea!</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Isa.24.16"><span class="verse-num">16&nbsp;</span>From the uttermost part of the earth have we heard songs. Glory to the righteous! But I said, &ldquo;I pine away! I pine away! woe is me!&rdquo; The treacherous have dealt treacherously. Yes, the treacherous have dealt very treacherously.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Isa.24.17"><span class="verse-num">17&nbsp;</span>Fear, the pit, and the snare, are on you who inhabitant the earth.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Isa.24.18"><span class="verse-num">18&nbsp;</span>It will happen that he who flees from the noise of the fear will fall into the pit; and he who comes up out of the midst of the pit will be taken in the snare; for the windows on high are opened, and the foundations of the earth tremble.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Isa.24.19"><span class="verse-num">19&nbsp;</span>The earth is utterly broken. The earth is torn apart. The earth is shaken violently.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Isa.24.20"><span class="verse-num">20&nbsp;</span>The earth will stagger like a drunken man, and will sway back and forth like a hammock. Its disobedience will be heavy on it, and it will fall and not rise again.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Isa.24.21"><span class="verse-num">21&nbsp;</span>It shall happen in that day that Yahweh will punish the army of the high ones on high, and the kings of the earth on the earth.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Isa.24.22"><span class="verse-num">22&nbsp;</span>They shall be gathered together, as prisoners are gathered in the pit, and shall be shut up in the prison; and after many days shall they be visited.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Isa.24.23"><span class="verse-num">23&nbsp;</span>Then the moon shall be confounded, and the sun ashamed; for Yahweh of Armies will reign on Mount Zion, and in Jerusalem; and before his elders will be glory.</span>
