<span class="verse" data-osis="Gal.5.1"><span class="verse-num verse-1">1&nbsp;</span>Stand firm therefore in the liberty by which Christ has made us free, and don&rsquo;t be entangled again with a yoke of bondage.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Gal.5.2"><span class="verse-num">2&nbsp;</span>Behold, I, Paul, tell you that if you receive circumcision, Christ will profit you nothing.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Gal.5.3"><span class="verse-num">3&nbsp;</span>Yes, I testify again to every man who receives circumcision, that he is a debtor to do the whole law.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Gal.5.4"><span class="verse-num">4&nbsp;</span>You are alienated from Christ, you who desire to be justified by the law. You have fallen away from grace.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Gal.5.5"><span class="verse-num">5&nbsp;</span>For we, through the Spirit, by faith wait for the hope of righteousness.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Gal.5.6"><span class="verse-num">6&nbsp;</span>For in Christ Jesus neither circumcision amounts to anything, nor uncircumcision, but faith working through love.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Gal.5.7"><span class="verse-num">7&nbsp;</span>You were running well! Who interfered with you that you should not obey the truth?</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Gal.5.8"><span class="verse-num">8&nbsp;</span>This persuasion is not from him who calls you.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Gal.5.9"><span class="verse-num">9&nbsp;</span>A little yeast grows through the whole lump.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Gal.5.10"><span class="verse-num">10&nbsp;</span>I have confidence toward you in the Lord that you will think no other way. But he who troubles you will bear his judgment, whoever he is.</span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="Gal.5.11"><span class="verse-num">11&nbsp;</span>But I, brothers, if I still preach circumcision, why am I still persecuted? Then the stumbling block of the cross has been removed.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Gal.5.12"><span class="verse-num">12&nbsp;</span>I wish that those who disturb you would cut themselves off.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Gal.5.13"><span class="verse-num">13&nbsp;</span>For you, brothers, were called for freedom. Only don&rsquo;t use your freedom for gain to the flesh, but through love be servants to one another.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Gal.5.14"><span class="verse-num">14&nbsp;</span>For the whole law is fulfilled in one word, in this: &ldquo;You shall love your neighbor as yourself.&rdquo;<span class="cf">+<dfn>Leviticus 19:18</dfn></span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Gal.5.15"><span class="verse-num">15&nbsp;</span>But if you bite and devour one another, be careful that you don&rsquo;t consume one another.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Gal.5.16"><span class="verse-num">16&nbsp;</span>But I say, walk by the Spirit, and you won&rsquo;t fulfill the lust of the flesh.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Gal.5.17"><span class="verse-num">17&nbsp;</span>For the flesh lusts against the Spirit, and the Spirit against the flesh; and these are contrary to one another, that you may not do the things that you desire.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Gal.5.18"><span class="verse-num">18&nbsp;</span>But if you are led by the Spirit, you are not under the law.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Gal.5.19"><span class="verse-num">19&nbsp;</span>Now the works of the flesh are obvious, which are: adultery, sexual immorality, uncleanness, lustfulness,</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Gal.5.20"><span class="verse-num">20&nbsp;</span>idolatry, sorcery, hatred, strife, jealousies, outbursts of anger, rivalries, divisions, heresies,</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Gal.5.21"><span class="verse-num">21&nbsp;</span>envyings, murders, drunkenness, orgies, and things like these; of which I forewarn you, even as I also forewarned you, that those who practice such things will not inherit the Kingdom of God.</span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="verse" data-osis="Gal.5.22"><span class="verse-num">22&nbsp;</span>But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faith,<span class="note">+<dfn>or, faithfulness</dfn></span></span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Gal.5.23"><span class="verse-num">23&nbsp;</span>gentleness, and self-control. Against such things there is no law.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Gal.5.24"><span class="verse-num">24&nbsp;</span>Those who belong to Christ have crucified the flesh with its passions and lusts.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Gal.5.25"><span class="verse-num">25&nbsp;</span>If we live by the Spirit, let&rsquo;s also walk by the Spirit.</span>

<span class="verse" data-osis="Gal.5.26"><span class="verse-num">26&nbsp;</span>Let&rsquo;s not become conceited, provoking one another, and envying one another.</span>
